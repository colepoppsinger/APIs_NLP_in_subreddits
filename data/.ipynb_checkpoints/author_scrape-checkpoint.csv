2,t4cx8p,carsononline,Help with Lelit Bianca Paddle Resolution,"So, I have a lelit bianca, and it seems as though I have almost no resolution with the paddle.  Example:

Closed (far left) no flow.  This is good.

Straight left 1-2 bars.  Again, good.

Anything beyond this, it goes all the way up to full pressure (or near that).  VERY quickly raises pressure before the straight left position.  

Seems as though the actual usable resolution of the paddle is about 20 degrees.  From closed to straight left.  Anything beyond seems to be almost wide open.  I cant seem to slowly ramp up pressure as I intended to do with this machine.  I did lower the overall pressure to 10 bar via the copper adjustment on the bottom.  

Any ideas?  Is this normal?  Works OK, but I thought there would be a much greater ability to play with pressure.

This machine would be used in a shop and the coffee is for the employees as well as clients. For clients, speed can be a factor so I will use ESE pods when the coffee needs to be ready fast. There are various options for buying pods and I'll get the ground coffee from coffee houses.

I'm thinking about either getting the Gaggia New Classic (RI9480) or the Quick Mill (MOD.0820Bi) as they fit in terms of size and price. 

While the Gaggia is cheaper and ESE ready, I don't like so much that it seems to be using an aluminium boiler. I'd prefer to spend a bit more upfront for high quality materials that will last a long time, without having to worry about possible aluminium leaks. Perhaps that's an overreaction though?

One day it failed, the lever just wouldn't turn, I dont think I dropped it or anything but I dud constantly travel with it in my backpack so something may have happened there...

Anyways I looked for 1zpresso support online and sent a message, It took a little bit to hear back but they inmediately apologized saying it was chinese new year and they were not in the office.

After a few emails back and forth, they sent me a fedex slip to send all the way to China. It got there super quick and they received and wrote back in less than a day. They did say there was some roughing marks on it, but it was't unfixable. They fixed and sent it back to me and did not charge a penny. Not even for shipping, the whole thing took less than 3 weeks, I was really impressed, I konw I was under warranty, but other companies take forever to reply, and want to charge you shipping and taxes.

I really give 5 stars, and recommend 1zpresso to all of you, not only are the grinders great, you can also be confident that if anything goes wrong, these are decent people and the wont try to blame you for the malfunction.

TLDR buy a 1zpresso grinder with confidence, if you are decidind between 1zpresso and other brand, take into consideration the amazing warranty and support.

Some of us know it as our morning fuel, or maybe it‚Äôs your special time to experiment with caf√© creations. Some of us though, like myself, know it as the reason we‚Äôre alive.

I‚Äôd probably die without it, literally.

The reason why espresso has become a part of our lives or how large a part it plays is irrelevant here. Maybe you just decided you loved how your local barista made your cappuccino and you wanted to try it at home. Maybe your suspender-man-bun hipster barista friend gave you a shot ‚Äúon the house‚Äù and from then on you were hooked. No matter what your own attraction to it is, espresso is intense, captivating, alluring, and an often mysterious phenomenon that keeps people coming back for more.

Do you have a question about how to use something new? Want to know how many grams of coffee you should use or how fine you should grind it? Not sure about temperature adjustments? Wondering about your coffee's shelf life or the best way to store it? Maybe you‚Äôd just like some recommendations on new gear?

There are no stupid questions here, ask any question and the community and moderators will chime in to help you out! Even if you don‚Äôt actually know the answer to a question someone asked, don‚Äôt be afraid to comment just so you can participate in the conversation.

So is there someone that has an idea or even a solution?

I‚Äôve messed with grind settings (gone from 13 all the way down to 8 with no change, it was at 12 when I made it the first time I got it) and changed distribution, not distributing, hard tamp, normal tamp, and light tamp, warming up the brew head and cleaning i religiously but shots are still sour.

It‚Äôs channeling pretty bad no matter what I seem to do.

92,t3fdoc,KingCxnt,Barista Pro Dial in help,"Good morning all,

I recently got a Barista Pro as my first espresso machine. I have tried to watch a lot of videos to dial in my shot. Here is my process:
-	run portafilter empty to warm and clear
-	weigh out 18g of coffee and grind
-	ground beans into portafilter and use puck distributor / tamper
-	pull shot using program mode to be able to stop it once 2:1 ratio is reached

I have been following this process trying to dial in my shot to have the flow start around 8-10 seconds and reach my 2:1 ratio near 30 seconds. The issue is that sometimes I will follow the exact same process with amount, grind size, and tamping pressure but have completely different results. For example, this morning I made my girlfriend a latte and was very pleased with the results. Later in the morning I went to make my own following the same exact process and the espresso was barely dribbling out. Any thoughts? Thank you",espresso,1646054138

* Machine: Gaggia Carezza Deluxe (w/ pressurised portafilter)
* Grinder: Krups GVX231 burr grinder
* Roast date: 7th February
* Dose: 18g
* Yield: 36g
* Time: Varies, usually between 20 and 30 seconds
* Roast level: Dark/medium

Hi folks, looking for some assistance refining my shots from the Gaggia Carezza Deluxe. I'm an espresso newbie having only had filter coffee machines before and the machine I got was 2nd hand and at a reasonable price so figured it was worth the plunge into espresso.

My main issues so far is that the shots always come out very bitter/sour. So far I've tried sticking to a solid 18g dose and varying the grind size until the machine chokes and then I work backwards on the grind size. I have also tried varying between not tamping, lightly tamping, fully tamping and have found mixed results with this (for reference the guide for the machine itself recommends not tamping at all).

I am just seeking some general troubleshooting tips for pressurised/double walled baskets specifically as it seems that most 'espresso troubleshooting' online is based on a regular non-pressurised basket.

I am also considering depessurising the basket and replacing the shower screen, however this would require much more dialing in of the shot and I am still relatively new to this and feel like that would be overwhelming.

Thanks in advance,",espresso,1646042897

&amp;#x200B;

As the title suggests my wifes friend is going to sell their Rocket Giotto Evoluzione V2 dual boiler. I have an expobar minore IV dual boiler. The main differences i can see is the Rocket has a rotary pump (which is a big tick for me) and no PID... whereas mine has a PID. Not that i fiddle much with temperatures, so i tend to keep it at a stock temperature of 93\* C. 

&amp;#x200B;

I can pick the Giotto up for $2000 and probably sell mine for not too far off that. Is it worth the upgrade?  or is it even an upgrade?  I'm not familiar with Rocket as a brand.

I‚Äôm about to pull the trigger on one of these, and I need some help deciding. I know there‚Äôs tons of threads, but I‚Äôm looking for opinions from people who have upgraded to these machines from a Gaggia Classic w/ PID.

I drink only two espressos a day, mainly as an iced latte or a capuccino. But I regularly have people over that love coffee as well.

I‚Äôd like to steam and pull shots at the same time, and I like the fast heat up time of the Gaggia, hence my choice with these machines.

Things I disliked about the Gaggia was the drip tray was so high that I couldn‚Äôt pull shots directly into a taller cup. Steaming also took forever. I did like the preinfusion, as I think it helped with channeling.

My heart is leaning towards the Mara X because it has the highest clearance for the drip tray and it can be upgraded to wooden knobs to upgrade it to look like a mini Bianca.

But my mind is telling me to choose the Profitec Pro 300 for reliability‚Ä¶ although the drip tray looks much higher. Also, the Elizabeth has preinfusion‚Ä¶. So that makes the choices btw these three machines tough.",espresso,1646006285

186,t2fqws,Freddy_Freedom,Caffeine content variance per grinder/machine. Just upgraded &amp; whoa! How is this possible?,"Hey guys, some questions about caffeine content and how that can vary with grind and machine. I recently upgraded from the Breville barista to the Breville dual boiler and smart grinder pro. 

The results in the espresso that the two produce are astonishingly different! The flavor is definitely richer and smokier, but the other main thing that I‚Äôm noticing is the caffeine content seems to be incredibly higher with the new double boiler and smart grinder pro.

But if I‚Äôm in a situation where I‚Äôm ordering a drink at Starbucks, I will order a triple grande latte. When I‚Äôm making a beverage at home with my Barista, I‚Äôll make it essentially the same drink: triple shot latte. That seems to be the perfect drink / ratio for my tastes. 

But with this new rig, I literally can‚Äôt even tolerate a double shot! In fact, I tried a single shot today and still found it to be too stimulating!! Same exact beans. HOW CAN THIS BE?!? I‚Äôm dumbfounded here. Is it possible that a single shot from this setup could have as much or more caffeine than a triple shot from the Breville Barista or Starbucks?

I‚Äôm wondering if somehow the grinder may be also highlighting or extracting extra impurities from the beans? I just find it so mysterious and strange that I cannot tolerate a double shot out of this machine, whereas I can tolerate one out of almost any caf√© in town. What‚Äôs the different factor here? I will try new beans immediately, but the fact that I can use the same beans in another machine without any issues is boggling my mind. 

From my reading in this group, it seems that the grinder is playing the biggest role here in the difference, some others said that if I used this grinder with my Barista that I would have similar results. I haven‚Äôt tried that yet since it‚Äôs in another city. 

For the first time in my life, I‚Äôm literally looking into getting decaf espresso beans! Is that what is required with this super hot Rod rig? Obviously I‚Äôm more sensitive to caffeine than some people, but the fact that I can tolerate a triple shot from Starbucks or out of the Barista is really hard to understand.

Can anyone please help to shed some light on this and help me understand? I will say that it is pretty annoying to spend all of this money for the upgrade and then not even be able to drink the espresso coming out of it LOL",espresso,1645935766

I am considering buying either a Breville Barista Express or Touch and I was wondering if there is a difference between the built-in grinders of these two machines? From my understanding, the grinder is just as important as the machine, if not more so. With that said, the Touch has 30 grind settings while the Express has 16 I think. I couldn't find more information online about the grinders &amp; burrs in the two machines, so I'm not sure if they're the same or not. What say you, my good coffee people, does anyone know more about the grinders between these 2 machines? 

I was also keen on a Gaggia Classic but was put off by the fact that they use a mix of aluminium and steel for their boilers, while Breville uses pure stainless steel. I would prefer stainless steel as the boiler material which comes into contact with the water over aluminium. Does anyone here know more about the construction of the Gaggia Classic boilers? Is the inside section which is in contact with the water the stainless steel part, while maybe the outside is where the aluminium is, or is it an alloy mix of both metals, so water will always be in contact with aluminium?

I use a double basket, grind 18g of beans and pull 18g of coffee. With these settings i feel like my coffee ends up a bit too sour. My first thought would be finer grind however, as mentioned before that clogs my machine and when i watch the water pass through with the settings I have now, it LOOKS like a great extraction. Not too watery, pretty thick and i end with about a 1:1.5 ratio of crema to coffee. So my next question to myself if i cant adjust grind size is, is the bean itself just sour? medium to light roast and the description did say a bit of a citrus after taste.

I believe from the factory it's set at 94C. So if you set it onto the coffee mode and wait, it should (and used to) come up to 92C or so, the blinking light would stop blinking and stay on solid, and then it might rise to between 94-96C, until you turned on the pump.

Now, it seems to come up to between 92C to way above 96C - possibly even up to 104C or so - and the blinking light never seems to stop blinking.

Now I know with the PID you can program it and all that, but, I'm not sure why it's behaving differently and it doesn't seem like you should have to mess around with the settings that, frankly, were pulling great shots at first.

So first: any idea why it's doing this?
Second: is it a problem for the boiler? I don't know what kind of behaviour wears out a boiler, whether it's turning on and off, or keeping it on above certain temperatures, or what. I can probably fix this issue by re-programming the PID but if there's no need to - let's say it's still making a great cup AND none of this is wearing out the boiler prematurely - then I will tell my dad to forget about it and just enjoy his espresso.",espresso,1645910608

221,t22ly0,Majestic-Translator,Upgrade from Rancilio Silvia v. 3 w/ PID to a Rancilio Silvia Pro X,"After serving as my daily workhorse machine for almost a decade, I just upgrade to a Silvia Pro X. I know there is not much information about this machine out there yet from actual users, so I figured I'd post my initial reactions after five days of daily use (perhaps.... too much use as I experiment with grind size). 

1) The quality and durability seem to be what you except from Rancilio Silvias. One of the screws in the top plate was not screwed in straight, which I found.... odd.... from a quality control issue. There was a small bead on the white paint on the steel side. My old v. 3 was just stainless and I opted for white with this machine. 

2) The upgrades, especially the variable soft infusion and double boiler, are game changers. I was pretty adept at pulling delicious beautiful shots with my v. 3 after years of barista experience on pro machines, but the Silvia Pro X's upgrades really do up my game with pulling shots. I also think the  pressure gauge, dual boiler, and built-in shot timer are really helpful. I'm not sure if this is just my adrenaline based on my excitement playing with a new toy, but I do believe the pressure when pulling a shot is much more consistent from beginning to end. It could be that my old v.3 was just showing its age. 

3) The portafilter and tamp feel much nicer than the v. 3. I will upgrade the portafilter to a bottomless with walnut handle, as well as upgrade the steam knob to the same and purchase an upgraded drip tray. 

4) This machine is much heftier and takes up significantly more counter space. I used to have a Rancilio stand with drawers for temp wands, scale, and a built-in knock box, for the sivlia v. 3, but the Pro X will not fit under my cabinets on the kitchen counter with the stand. 

5) I was really hesitant purchasing a new model machine without seeing one in person first. I thought I'd go with another brand machine in the $1800-2500 price range, but at the end of the day I feel very much at home with the Rancilio brand. 

In any case, I am happy with the purchase and would make it again. Now if I can figure out how to slow down with my daily espresso intake.....",espresso,1645897343

238,t1yxf0,Black_LikeCoffee,"A First-Time Buyer's Contemplations, Input Appreciated","Hi Everyone! 

To preface this, I am very much so a beginner when it comes to the world of espresso but I've been brewing pour overs for years now and enjoy changing different variables and techniques for dialing in coffee or for my own curiosity.

I've been looking at a few machines for a while now and I keep going back and forth between them because they all seem to have features I love but have a quality that makes me look at another. I would appreciate any feedback on my thoughts be it in the form of alternative products, educating me on facts that I might have gotten wrong, or even clever solutions to the qualities that irk me for a product.

To make things easier, I will start with my coffee preferences. I drink my espresso as is, I might fancy a milk drink once in many blue moons but just espresso is my main desire. When it comes to roast preference I love medium roasts but I want to be light roast capable since I also enjoy the refreshing berry notes. 

**Budget:** Roughly $500, I say roughly because I am willing to shell out more if the quality is really that significant and I live by ""buy once, cry once"".

**Contenders:**

**Gaggia Classic Pro:** From the first glance I was drawn to this machine. Simplistic design, tactile rocker switches, great reputation of brewing great espresso, within my budget comfortably, and recommended in one way or another by the coffee content creators I watch: James Hoffmann, Kyle Roswell, and Xris. 

My main deterrents for this machine however was brought up by a coffee blogger named ""The Coffee Chronicler"". I've been told that the OPV mod for 9 bars of pressure was pretty much mandatory and temperatures can be inconsistent which calls for installing PIDs or temperature surfing. I dislike the idea of having to mod my purchase out of the principle that it should be ready to pull quality shots out of the box...because that's why I purchased it. Dialing in coffee is not the same as modding my machine in my opinion for this hobby. The OPV mod I can tolerate much more as its cheap and apparently quite easy to do but I am firmly against the idea of installing a PID but then temperature surfing sounds very inconsistent to me coming from someone who's used an electric temperature kettle for so long and appreciates a digital confirmation of consistency.

**Breville Infuser:** I came across this product while searching for a machine that has a consistent and adjustable temperature PID. The design aesthetically is honestly not my preference, the buttons don't seem very satisfying, and it's reaching out of my comfort zone in terms of budget but it allows me to control another variable.

**Breville Bambino Plus:** I've heard good things about this product from ""The Coffee Chronicler"" and that it brews a very consistent cup of coffee unlike the Gaggia Classic Pro but where it falls short is that the temperature is locked in at 200f and struggles a lot with lighter roast coffee. Design wise, I like it much more than the Infuser, and while nowhere near aesthetically pleasing as the GCP, I would not mind using it. 

Are my dislikes warranted? Can they be overcome? Are there any other products that should be taken into consideration? Am I being too fussy?",espresso,1645887474

So I've been lurking in r/espresso for a long time trying absorb all I can about the home espresso game before buying a machine but I've come to a sort of impass. I know i want the hobby. I've saved up for something nice. But I honestly don't know how deep to go. 

  I'd be making daily coffee(s) for my wife and myself, maybe the rare family gathering too. She likes milk drinks, I like espressos.

  I bought a niche zero early into the process, knowing I would buy a machine eventually and I currently use it for my French press. So my grinder is already locked in. 

As for the machines, I think I've narrowed my search to three of them; the bambino(not plus), the rancilio silva pro x, and the lelit bianca. 

The bambino is only really on the list because I want my wife to not be afraid of making her own latte if she wants. But I'd really honestly prefer a sturdier machine. Plus I have a feeling I'll want to upgrade as soon as I get it. 

The silva pro x just released and it looks like a great machine withsome really nice bells and whistles. I like the dual boiler pids and pre-infusion. This is currently what I'm leaning towards. 

The Bianca is the upper limits of my budget. But I like the idea of flow control and its plumbable which is a big plus. Would it really be worth the extra grand though? I don't know.

Over the past year, I've finally gotten into espresso and have thoroughly enjoyed it. As it happens... I've upgraded to a DE1PRO and now to a NZ, from a Sette-wi.

I've been experiencing something a little odd with the Niche, and I'm curious to hear if any of you have had this experience. I've heard how great the Niche is at switching between grind settings. I haven't even tried, because I can't even get the adjustment ring to work well enough to dial in as accurately as I'd like with espresso.

For example, If a shot is brewing at around 23 or 24 seconds, I may have to move the adjustment ring a significant amount: probably about 3 notches, to move it up to 28 seconds for the shot.

But towards the finer end of the ""espresso"" marking on the grinder, suddenly it becomes MUCH more sensitive. I'll literally turn it 1/2 notch at most, and suddenly the 28 second brew time is 33 seconds.

This is consistent from puck to puck, and it always seems to happen around the same point on the adjustment ring. I've tried over and over again to get a shot at exactly 30 seconds just to verify that I'm able to dial in as accurately as I should be, but it's either 28 seconds or 33.

382,t08jov,Left-Procedure6851,Gaggia Classic Pro flow rate too fast with 5 bar and 6.5 bar OPV spring," Dear coffee lovers,

I will be extremely glad if you share your insights with me on this issue.

I have a Gaggia Classic Pro 2019 model. I pull shots on bottomless Gaggia portafilter and a VST 16-18 gram basket (also stock baskets)

When I bought it I right away had to change the spring and I purchased 3  springs via Shades of Coffee - 9bar, 6.5 and 5. since my coffee was grinded for espresso.  
I buy freshly roasted coffee from a local barista shop and they grind it  for me for Espresso - one step before the most fine grind on their  grinder.

I put 22grams in the 16-18 VST basket and the portafilter is inserted  easily - I could even go higher to 23. Unfortunately whatever basket I  use (stock ones as well) the coffee comes around 40-50 grams at least  for 15-20 seconds at best for the 22 grams and this is with the 5 bar  OPV spring.

I always tamper the coffee with even pressure and I WDT-it before that. I  purchased a kit to measure the OPV spring bar pressure and it shows 5  bars with the 5 bar spring.

I tried - supermarket coffee beans, pre-ground coffee, coffee from different roasters ground for 'espresso portafilters' - the coffee always flows too fast. I almost don't notice drastic difference between 5 bar and 9  bar springs as well.

Do you know what may cause the issue? The single success I had was with extremely fine grinded coffee for *cezve*  \- turkish pot coffee, the guys from the coffee shop told me that this is very-fine ground and usually they never sell it that fine. 

I hope you guys have any clues how to deal with this. I have a Gaggia  MDF grinder - it doesn't grind fine enough to slow the flow-rate of the  coffee. üì∑

384,t04xqx,sauce_box_,Ok I did it. And now I have questions.,"I just bought my first machine, the breville barista express. I‚Äôve always loved coffee, I live in a great coffee city, and I‚Äôve gotten pretty good at pour overs and cold brew, just have literally never pulled a shot before this machine. 

I‚Äôve pulled quite a few shots now, and I‚Äôve only pulled one that was good (and god damn was it good) but all the others have been sour with a soupy puck. I am grinding pretty damn fine, (2-3 on the BBE, maybe I need to adjust the burrs?). I‚Äôm using a dark roast espresso blend from a local shop, although it was roasted I think about a week-10 days past the ‚Äúideal‚Äù range. 18 grams feels very full (I can‚Äôt even wdt without knocking a gram or so out, just ordered a dosing cone) and they were all sour so I moved down to 16. No luck. I messed some up because I either forgot to turn on the scale, start the time, etc but I got better with the last 7 or so shots. 

This could be the most cliche issue of the sub, and I just need to adjust my burrs and.... grind finer. But I want to be sure I‚Äôm not missing anything. the shots I recorded stats with are below, all sour but the first. 

Btw I‚Äôm not using the pressurized basket I‚Äôm tryna get good m80. 

- 18 in, 38 out, 33(?) seconds, 3 grind (this was good)
- a couple other 18g shots I did the next day, all sour. Didn‚Äôt write down numbers but similar to the one before. 
- 16 in, 49 out, 22 seconds, 2 grind
- 16 in,  ? Out (too much, like 45), 17 seconds, 2 grind
- 16 in, 36 out, 17 seconds, 2 grind, harder ramp
- 18 in, 26 out, 23 seconds, 2 grind, harder ramp 
- 18 on, 40 out, 20 seconds, 2 grind, harder ramp

Honestly I know it‚Äôs probably over kill, but I like the looks of the Linea Mini and highly considering it. That being said, what are your favorite calibrated tampers and distributors for the portafilter? 

Upgrading to VST baskets seem to be worth it? Thoughts.

438,szoh0y,shreddah17,Specific Questions to Help Decide Between Breville Barista Express and the DeLonghi La Specialista EC9335,"We're buying our first espresso machine to upgrade our $10 Mr. Coffee drip coffee maker!

I've got it narrowed down to the two in the title - I really prefer to have a built-in grinder as we have limited counterspace to work with. Here's what I know about the two:

Breville: Non-pressurized portafilter combined with more adjustability on the grinder will make an objectively better shot with perhaps a steeper learning curve.

DeLonghi: Comes with a pressurized portafilter and fewer grind settings. While this makes it harder to mess up, it makes it impossible to achieve a really great shot. 

&amp;#x200B;

Now, despite this, the DeLonghi is more appealing to us for a few reasons:

* Built-in tamper reduces mess (We don't like mess)
* Hot water spout location means you can make Americanos without moving the cup. Seeing as that's the most common drink we drink, it's a really nice benefit.
* DeLonghi has a 2 year warranty extendable to 3 compared to a 1 year warranty on the Breville

&amp;#x200B;

My questions:

* Is a pressurized basket *really* all that bad for our first machine?
* Can't we swap it out for a non-pressurized basket anyway?
   * I know the counter to this point is that the fewer grind settings mean a non-pressurized basket would be harder to dial in; even impossible in some cases. That makes sense to me, but say I was able to dial in a particular bean within the provided grind range - couldn't I just keep using that same bean and be OK with the less adjustable grinder on the DeLonghi? This is really the crux in making our decision.

Lastly, I know we would probably be better off getting the machine and grinder separately. At least for now, I'm ruling that out. I'm really just wondering if the less-adjustable grinder and the pressurized basket on the DeLonghi make it a poor choice over the Breville, or if we can work around those limitations. 

Finally, there's about a $200 price difference. Ignore that for now as well. Thanks!!",espresso,1645641409
439,sznnf7,rivenwyrm,Tips for running my Solis Barista Perfetta: channeling &amp; group head cleaning?,"I upgraded to a Solis Barista Perfetta (I know that's nothin fancy but baby steps) from a Capresso machine a while back and it's allowed me to make some really delicious espressos with a variety of beans but I've got two persistent issues:  


* Channeling in one specific spot slightly behind and out from the center
* Cleaning the group head

I don't really know how to address the first one except to try and buy some kind of dispersion screen. Is that the right thing to do? Are there other options? It regularly channels in this same spot no matter how hard or softly tamped.

Second question is basically just hygiene: What's the best way to clean grounds off the brew head between shots? I've been running a single shot through with the portafilter in to warm things up, which seems to clean it effectively but then I have to blast the portafilter with water or lightly rinse then scrape the filter with my finger to get the grounds out of the screen. Either option is annoying and cools it down a lot. Is there some basic technique for this I simply don't know? Should I be wiping the group head with a towel first? Or something?

447,szmf9j,Sing1eMalt,Season internal grinder burrs e.g. Breville Barista Pro etc?,"I am aware that for discerning palates, using a machine like the Breville Barista Pro as a Machine and Grinder might normally be considered inferior to even something like the Bambino and a Eureka Specialita at a similar cost.

That said, I think the BBP likely meets all of my first machine purchasing factors better due to: 
(1) ease of use for wife
(2) easier/more hot water for teas/americanos/other kitchen recipes
(3) simplified form factor and workflow in a small space.

My question is more related to the seasoning of the internal burrs on an integrated grinder like the BBP.  

My very limited understanding of espresso grinders is that in most cases, consistency will vary from shot to shot for a ‚Äúbreak in‚Äù period while the burrs are naturally seasoned.  You can accelerate this seasoning by intentionally grinding several pounds/kilograms of coffee through the grinder to coat the burrs with coffee oils/extracts even if you don‚Äôt intend to brew most of the resulting grounds.  This will lead to better performing and more consistent doses long term.

So for an internal grinder like the BBP, does accelerated seasoning make sense?  I anticipate 3-4 drinks a day on the machine and totally understand that the internal grinder will likely never achieve the same consistency as a stand-alone prosumer grinder, but will it improve consistency at all?

The trade-offs I associate with the internal grinder are:
(1) much smaller burr size [40mm conical]
(2) higher retention and/or exchange [not a huge problem for me at this stage of my journey]
(3) less robust build/ability for multiple back-to-back grinds to cause dis-alignment of the burr settings [not as big of a concern for my low volume usage]
(4) less consistent dose [the point of my question]

If I were to season the burrs by running day 10 pounds of coffee through the internal grinder over a few days, would I get at least acceptably consistent dose weights grinding on demand (not single dosing)?  I know I likely won‚Äôt get ideal segmentation of bean fragment sizes with the smaller stepped burrs, but I can live with a less clean tasting output if I can count on the consistent dose weight.


TL;DR Is it worthwhile to season the burrs of an internal grinder, I don‚Äôt see it recommended as much as I do for more advanced grinders?  If so, can I expect reasonably consistent output in grams even if there‚Äôs some significant exchange occurring?",espresso,1645636105

Longgggtime barista @ various third wave coffee shops, have now left the industry for other work and missing espresso life. 

I‚Äôve just bought a Gaggia Classic Pro and am excited to make some of the recommended mods to take it to the next level. 
I was planning on buying the Baratza encore to work alongside it - only to discover it may not be everything I need. 

I am seeing a Eureka Crono grinder on a pretty decent sale right now, putting it into my price range. The crono has the 50mm flat filter burrs. 

Is it really as easy as replacing the burrs with the 50mm flat burrs from the manuale, specializa, or silencio to take my at-home grinding to the next level (not step.. heh, see what I did there?)

Any help or recommendations on doing this would be HIGHLY appreciated.
The crono is cashing in at half the price as the next best actual-espresso-grinding machine in CAD, which I think would make a mod worth it??

522,syws7m,AutoModerator,Simple Questions Thread,"Welcome to the r/Espresso question thread!

Some of us know it as our morning fuel, or maybe it‚Äôs your special time to experiment with caf√© creations. Some of us though, like myself, know it as the reason we‚Äôre alive.

I‚Äôd probably die without it, literally.

The reason why espresso has become a part of our lives or how large a part it plays is irrelevant here. Maybe you just decided you loved how your local barista made your cappuccino and you wanted to try it at home. Maybe your suspender-man-bun hipster barista friend gave you a shot ‚Äúon the house‚Äù and from then on you were hooked. No matter what your own attraction to it is, espresso is intense, captivating, alluring, and an often mysterious phenomenon that keeps people coming back for more.

Do you have a question about how to use something new? Want to know how many grams of coffee you should use or how fine you should grind it? Not sure about temperature adjustments? Wondering about your coffee's shelf life or the best way to store it? Maybe you‚Äôd just like some recommendations on new gear?

There are no stupid questions here, ask any question and the community and moderators will chime in to help you out! Even if you don‚Äôt actually know the answer to a question someone asked, don‚Äôt be afraid to comment just so you can participate in the conversation.

We all had to start somewhere and sometimes it‚Äôs hard figuring out just what you‚Äôre doing right or wrong. Luckily, the r/Espresso community is full of helpful and friendly people.

You can still post questions as an official post if you feel it warrants a larger discussion, but try to make use of this area so that we can help keep things organized in case others potentially have similar questions.",espresso,1645560015

527,sytulw,smdntn,Having issues with light roast‚Ä¶ am I on the right track?,"I‚Äôve got a sage/breville barista express and been struggling with dialling in my machine and getting consistent results.

I order beans from a local roasters, Brazilian single origin with notes that my partner and I really enjoy. I‚Äôve today noticed that it‚Äôs a light roast and I didn‚Äôt know much about that impact on trying to pull decent espresso when I first ordered (subscription based). It makes me think that this may have been one of my problems. 

I‚Äôm getting ok drinks (we only drink milk based coffee) and so it is palatable but some drinks are better than others. However the shot runs pale quite quickly and just doesn‚Äôt really cut through the milk. I would describe the espresso itself as sour but unfortunately my palate is not very well developed when it comes to espresso. I‚Äôve changed the internal burrs to 2, and the external grind size is 8, if I grind finer I end up choking the machine‚Ä¶ 

Interestingly, the webpage from the roasters says:

""This style of Omni roasting coffee tends to mean that light roast single origins will also work for espresso but only with the right equipment. This means you need a really good espresso coffee grinder (like a La Marzocco Lux D) and a great espresso machine. In addition, you also need the time and energy to develop your barista skills to get the best from single-origin espresso coffee.‚Äù

I‚Äôve now ordered their ‚Äúespresso‚Äù blend to try as these beans are meant to be more forgiving.

The other things I‚Äôve done are:
1. Single dosing due to the unfortunately shoddy built in grinder
2. Upped the dose to 20g with a 40g yield aiming over 30 seconds (sometimes it‚Äôs near, sometimes it‚Äôs well over 30s and I can‚Äôt discern why)
3. Use a distribution tool before tamping 
4. Ordered a Normcore v4 tamper for consistent tamp (to remove this variable) (on back order)
5. Planning to buy an IMS basket once these become more available for breville 54mm size 

So, I will be dialling the machine back in again once the new beans arrive.

I am learning to dial in my espresso and am currently playing with my new set up.

I have a Breville Bambino (cannot change temperature or pressure set a 9bars and 200f), a 1zpresso J max and I am using bean from a local roaster (beans I have are medium roast and were roasted on February 2nd).

I had once an amazing shot that tasted better than the one I get from the roaster himself. Cannot replicate since. Most of my shots are decent and I don't get a mess from the bottomless portafilter but I feel that they tend to be a bit bitter.

Brew pump never went into the espresso range, and I didn't really think anything of it.  About 6 months ago, after almost a year of it sitting idle, I tried to use it and nothing came out.  Figure it was broken.  So of course, it can't be my fault, so I started doing research on higher-end machines, found this reddit sub thing, watched a ton of videos.  Learned how to measure, tamp, WDT, etc...  

I saw the prices of grinders and I was like, holy cripes, that's insane.  Hundreds, if not thousands on a grinder?  Like, it grinds beans.  They are all the same.  My BBE has a grinder built into it!  Those espresso nuts were just overzealous and nitpicky.  I was going to buy the cheapest grinder I could find to pair with my shiny new machine.  

I was never able to get a 1:2 ratio double shot in 25-35 seconds.  It was always about 12-14 seconds even on the finest grind.  So figured it had to be the grind, because by now I was confident I understood the basics.  

It's only money, right?  So I bit the bullet.   I splurged on a Niche Zero.  I only single dose, and the reviews seem to be glowing.  It arrived today.  

Default was 20.  For my first shot, I turned it finer yet (12) and when it came out, I couldn't believe what I was seeing.  The smallest damn grounds I've ever seen.  I measured 16g, and I said to my wife, there is no way this machine is going to produce any liquid.  Sure enough, I turned it on and nothing came out.  Stopped it after 27 seconds.  Turned the Niche to 16.  Tried it again.  I got 11g in 52 seconds.  Try number three, put it back to 20.  Got 33g in 33 seconds and had the tastiest latte in years.  All with a new grinder.  I really don't do espresso, but tomorrow I'm going to do a side-by-side with the built-in grinder vs the Niche.  I probably need to go to a cafe and drink a real espresso in order to know what it is really supposed to taste like, but I'm now a believer that a grinder really does make a difference!

I‚Äôm looking to purchase the Gaggia Classic Pro as my first good quality espresso machine. I‚Äôve had a cheap Capresso for a couple years and am ready to invest! I have a couple questions:

1. Where do I purchase the spring to make the machine 9 bar instead of 15? 

2. Where do you suggest to buy a bottomless portofilter? Tamper? Scale?

3. I am planning to either get the Eureka Mignon Notte or the Settle 270wi depending on how much I get as a bonus this year. I noticed that if I purchase the Gaggia through Whole Latte Love I can bundle with the Settle 270. What‚Äôs the difference between 270 &amp; 270wi? Which do you suggest?

4.  At the cheapest of my range‚Ä¶ if I were to purchase the JX PRO 1Zpresso , would this be good enough for the Gaggia until I can upgrade?

I‚Äôm at a loss with my Gaggia Classic. After descaling a couple of weeks ago, I have been getting nothing but fast and sour shots. I use nothing but filtered water in the machine.

To clarify some common troubleshooting issues I‚Äôve seen on the internet, my machine has been set to 9 bars and I WDT with an Option-O tool.

Neither of these have been able to choke my machine. I follow Lance Hedrick‚Äôs temp surfing routine and have even tried turning the steam button on for 15 sec prior to pulling a shot to see if the sourness was due to brew temp.

I‚Äôve tried 15g, 18g and 20g doses in my IMS competition basket at ~40g out and my shots are in the 19-24 second range. I got 26 sec with my 5 clicks setting on my C40 but the shot was still extremely acidic. I‚Äôll admit that some shots have had minor channeling but some pucks have been perfect and still super sour.

The coffee I used is a medium roast from a local roaster. The notes are caramel and chocolate malt, so it‚Äôs not like I‚Äôm using really light acidic beans. They have been off roast for about 2 weeks.

657,sxdtez,pizzarunner,Budget Setup Success,"I impulse bought a Breville Bambino (non-plus) a few weeks ago at a liquidation store for $150. They had a few accessories from whatever store they'd liquidated, so I got a generic ali-baba looking bottomless portafilter ($15) and a .1g scale  with a timer ($7). Picked up an open box JX-Pro on amazon for $140. So all in under $350.

I was a barista at a high volume 3rd wave shop/roaster around 10 years ago so I have made and drank a considerable amount of espresso, but after using pro machines the older generation of home offerings always seemed finicky and well... just kind of a pain in the ass, so I never considered buying one. Process (and aesthetics...) is important to me and a machine that requires all sorts of odd hacks and tricks like some of the older generation home machines just isn't appealing to me for every day use. Hadn't really looked at what was available in the realm of home espresso probably 6-7 years and was surprised to see so many more decent looking home machines and grinders at all price levels.

After getting things dialed in a bit I'm consistently impressed with the quality of shots the Bambino pulls, and how pleasant it is to work with. Sure, it lacks a bit in fine tuning options, but the manual pre-infusion and shot timing is at least nice to have. I'm consistently pulling gorgeous shots on the naked portafilter that are nearly as good as anything I can buy locally. The thermojet system seems to get ragged on a bit but it does exactly what I want it to - the machine basically pulls shots on demand, with no need to heat up a boiler, and provides a nearly instant transition between pulling shots and steaming milk. The steam wand behaves as I'd expect - my muscle memory from steaming milk as a barista still works, although my hands are a little less calloused now and I can't gauge the milk temp by feel very accurately :D

The JX-Pro has absolutely blown me away, even more than the machine. My last experience with a hand grinder was a hario skerton, which I found to be only slightly more functional (and pleasant to use) than putting the coffee beans in a plastic bag and smashing them with a rock. This thing is simply a joy to use. Consistent and easy to dial in or swap grind settings for different brew methods. Grinds efficiently enough that I don't even mind hand grinding 60g of beans for a large batch of pour over coffee to share. Extremely satisfying heft and build quality.

Altogether, it's a setup that I'm excited to use every morning, makes coffee I'm excited to drink, and looks great sitting on my counter. Hard to beat that for $350!",espresso,1645397692

- - IMS 18g Nanotech Basket
- 1Zpresso JX-Pro (gray dot)
- Normcore v4 58.5 Tamper 

Coffee:
- Onyx Geometry, roasted 11 Feb

Process:
- Weigh 16.5g beans (ive dropped dose from 18g because the puck was sticking to the shower screen)
- Spray with misted water
- Grind with JX-Pro at 1.4.3
- Dump into basket
- WDT scraping bottom of basket
- WDT top layer of grounds 
- Tamp with Normcore v4 
- Temp Surf:
- - Engage brew switch until light turns off, turn off
- - 10s count, then engage steam switch
- - 5s count, then disengage steam switch, begin brew
- While temp surfing, install pf, place/tare scale with shot glass
- Start timer when engaging brew switch after temp surf 
- 6s preinfusion (via 1/8 turn of steam valve once brew switch is engaged)
- close steam valve, monitor scale 
- stop brew at 41g

Last brew was around 21s including preinfusion. There was a decent amount of channeling based on the bottom of the naked pf.

Been using the NS Adapter on my Nanopresso this weekend and running into a strange problem: first brew was fine, subsequent \~12 brews all now having this issue. A few months ago on vacation I used it \~6x/day for a week solid and didn't notice any issues.

To be clear, I am \*NOT\* talking about the \*larger\* foil cover on the capsule (ie: the end the water flows out of right before going into your cup) -- I am talking about the \*smaller\* foil at the inlet of the capsule.

After brewing, I unsrew the capsule-holder to empty it and the capsule comes out but the small foil of it's inlet remains stuck down inside the holder's prongs. It is my understanding that the prongs are supposed to merely \*puncture\* the foil, but in my case they appear to be ripping the foil off -- as if inside they were turning around the edge of the foil and cleanly slicing it off -- and then when I remove the capsule, a tiny circle of foil remains wedged in the middle of the prong-ring, stuck. 

As you might imagine, this leaves a bunch of grounds behind, but mostly trapped between the filter basket and the pump -- the coffee is still mostly clean of grounds and drinkable.

It is just our non-instant version of a Caf√© frapp√©,"So today I tried a foamed americano, which has been trending the last couple of days around here. I think the foamed americano is just the espresso version of a Caf√© frapp√©, which originated in Greece. 

In case you haven't heard of a Caf√© frapp√© before, here is how it's traditionally served: Instant coffee is foamed with a special foaming device or in a cocktail shaker. The foamed instant coffee is then poured into a glass containing water and ice. It is commonly served sweetened and optionally with milk. This is what a Caf√© frapp√© looks like (image taken from [wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frapp%C3%A9_coffee)):

I first tasted a Caf√© frapp√© on my trip to Cyprus before Covid hit. It tastes quite similar to the foamed americano, but since it is created with instant coffee, it has that distinct instant coffee flavor if you know what I mean.

I thought y'all might be interested in the 'original' foamed americano.

I have an ECM Classika PID with the same issue, as described here [https://www.reddit.com/r/espresso/comments/on8nms/ecm\_classika\_pid\_plasticrubber\_in\_steamhot\_water/](https://www.reddit.com/r/espresso/comments/on8nms/ecm_classika_pid_plasticrubber_in_steamhot_water/), rubber pieces clogging and coming out of the steam wand. So I ordered the new rubber seal to replace the broken one, but in the meantime, I started to think: if I start taking the machine apart, what mods could I add to it?

I saw on a Clive Coffee, they have videos with a version that has a steam switch, instead of a rotary knob, as I understand, that would solve the issues with the rubber sealing too, as that switch doesn't have one. I couldn't find one though, that's explicitly advertised as a replacement for Classika. If I'd want to replace mine, which steam wands with a switch would be compatible with the Classika?

Then I read someone considering installing a flow control (though I'm not really at that level with espresso to understand what I could achieve with one.)

And I see there's a threaded hole on the grouphead, where one could install a thermometer? Or a manometer? Which one? And how useful is that?

I recently purchased an LM bottomless portafilter from Espresso Coffee Shop and it seems to have a few issues. 

The first one is that it has got a different logo embossed. All the pictures of the LM bottomless portafilter I can find online have got a different logo embossed. See the picture below for what I mean:

https://preview.redd.it/z8aattr6lvi81.png?width=1682&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=07332a7874368b2c9eedb9c81423876bc047c11b

Is this simply a matter of the old version vs the new or should I be concerned?

&amp;#x200B;

The second issue is that there is a small area inside the portafilter head where the stainless steel coating is scraped off (see pic below). I'm not even sure if the phrase ""stainless steel coating"" is accurate or not as from what I've read LM portafilters are entirely made from stainless steel. However, the colour of the ""scraped off"" area is quite bronze which makes me wonder if the portafilter head is made of brass and has a stainless steel coating applied to it.

&amp;#x200B;

Some of us know it as our morning fuel, or maybe it‚Äôs your special time to experiment with caf√© creations. Some of us though, like myself, know it as the reason we‚Äôre alive.

I‚Äôd probably die without it, literally.

The reason why espresso has become a part of our lives or how large a part it plays is irrelevant here. Maybe you just decided you loved how your local barista made your cappuccino and you wanted to try it at home. Maybe your suspender-man-bun hipster barista friend gave you a shot ‚Äúon the house‚Äù and from then on you were hooked. No matter what your own attraction to it is, espresso is intense, captivating, alluring, and an often mysterious phenomenon that keeps people coming back for more.

Do you have a question about how to use something new? Want to know how many grams of coffee you should use or how fine you should grind it? Not sure about temperature adjustments? Wondering about your coffee's shelf life or the best way to store it? Maybe you‚Äôd just like some recommendations on new gear?

There are no stupid questions here, ask any question and the community and moderators will chime in to help you out! Even if you don‚Äôt actually know the answer to a question someone asked, don‚Äôt be afraid to comment just so you can participate in the conversation.

https://greenled.co.nz/switches-dimmers/24-universal-led-light-dimmer.html#/27-dimmer_options-dimmer_only

...Is a suitable dimmer switch I found. Posts on other sites referred to other hardware store dimmers not being suitable because they weren't leading edge dimmers. This one seems to work fine.

I now have a flowrate range of 6mL/s - 8mL/s (without portafilter). 

Before the mod each shot was channeling like a shower head (seen through the naked portafilter).

After the mod, consistent good shots without channeling at the lower flowrates. This really makes a massive difference to the taste of the espresso. I'm pretty new to espresso and coffee machines so this has been a good development after a fair bit of frustration.
I've also been able to lower the grind size without producing channeling or gross tasting coffee.

The only problem I've noticed is that with the dimmer on low settings (less than half speed):
* the preinfusion produces a lot of steam and sometimes very little water
*The main shot frequently trips out and the machine gives the low water signal (alternating flashing shot lights)

I'm assuming this is because:
*The machine programme has preinfusion at a lower flowrate already and by lowering it even more the  Thermo jet heater is boiling the water (this probably isn't great fit the heating system = potential warping, fouling, burning out etc)
*There's a safety trip in the heading system when it detects what it thinks is no water in the thermojet when there should be (triggering the low water signal)

To get around this problem I now start the shot on full speed (the preinfusion part). Then when I hear the pump ramping up for the shot, I turn the dial down to whatever speed I want and so far have been producing my best shots this way. 
However, this is obviously all a bit of a faff and takes some coordination. A satisfactory solution is also to turn the dial to half speed and just leave it there. I can't grind as fine, and some channeling happens from time to time but I also don't have to go through the equivalent of the shuttle launch sequence to make a coffee in the morning.

If you're reading this I hope it helps you get your dimmer mod up and running. Especially if you're in NZ where there's less info and equipment around",espresso,1645298829

I have had my BBE for a year now and oh boy did it open the gates to the espresso obsession. I purchased a Niche Zero in anticipation for a dual boiler and I'm considering the Profitec Pro 600 with Flow Control from Whole Latte Love.

My concerns about moving from the BBE:

* Slower warm up time - I love being able to use it within a few minutes of turning it on
* Descaling the machine - seems like a much more involved process on the Profitec - we have reverse osmosis filtered water from Culligan, wondering how big of a deal it is with that consideration?

Why I'm excited considering the Profitec Pro 600

* Dual boiler - I make lattes or cortados every morning and I want to steam and brew at the same time!
* The steam power - again, I love a milk drink and I want more pressure from the steam wand!

Interested in people's perspective from moving to the Profitec Pro 600. Do you love it? What don't you like? What other machines in or below that price range ought I consider?

1. I use the stumptown hairbender coffee as I really liked when I had it coffee shops which used that bean.
2. I tamp by pressing down on a wooden board and turning it thrice clockwise
3. I always mix with around 4oz of milk frothed with macrofoam (with mixed degree of success)
4. With the last couple of shots, there was water on top of the puck in the portafilter when I took it out at the end, so still trying to research if thats good/bad/something I can ignore.",espresso,1645285183

any advice for my next machine? I'm looking for something with a pressure gauge, so I know I'm pulling consistent shots.

P.S. I need to upgrade my grinder as well, but I can always but a high-end manual grinder for a reasonable price (\~100-200USD), so that's less of a concern to me.

I dose 20gs of coffee(without RDT) into the dosing cup of df64 and pour into the basket with a dosing ring on it, then I do a little bit of WDT on the surface and temp with a self leveling temper. I also put a Bplus screen on the puck for extraction.

And as I observe channeling, I set the grind size coarser and coarser(now at 22 relative to the true zero point), but channeling is still occuring, although with coarser grind it should be less easy to happen, and the shot time now is very short to get 40g of liquid(around 16-18s), and I dont know if the quick flow rate is cause by channeling or the grind being too coarse.

I currently use a Flair Signature plus the Flair Royal grinder, which I really enjoy using and enjoy the manual aspect of pressing the lever and feeling the shot, but for making shots for my wife and I, its just too much work to use more than on the weekend.I really want to drink more espresso, but I can't spend 20 minutes right when I wake up making shots! 

Also, with the flair, a ""bad"" shot takes forever to redo so I really don't have much stomach for experimentation with it. The main painpoints are needing to clean and re-do the preheat between every shot, along with the general ""faff"" of moving around all the bits.

So, I'm looking to upgrade to something more premium with a better workflow, something that I could make a couple shots/americanos with easily enough in the morning. I'm ok doing some work, but the Flair is just too much. I'm also interested in making milk drinks, which the flair can't really do without external tools which add even more workflow.

I'm currently deciding between the Robot, Flair 58, and a more premium semi-auto like the Lelit Elizabeth. I have a smallish kitchen and like to cook, so not interested in the full counter being taken up by a coffee machine, but am ok with some space getting used. This is why I've narrowed down to these options, since they seem like the highest quality, most ""compact"" espresso machines available with a minimum amount of fuss.

Pros and cons for each:

Robot
* Pros: Cheapest option, no preheat for most roasts. Probably best quality espresso. Small.
* Cons: Not a huge fan of how it looks. Steam would be separate and annoying.

Flair 58:
* Pros: Looks better than robot. Built in pre-heat in case I get into light roasts. Easy pressure profiling for maximum experimentation. Cheap(ish).
* Cons: Big. Steam would be separate and annoying. The bulky power cord really bugs me, as I have nowhere to hide it.

Elizabeth:
* Pros: Easiest workflow. Fairly Compact. Probably easiest for my wife to learn. Easy steam and most repeatable results(?)
* Cons: No manual feedback (which I have quite enjoyed playing with on the Flair). Expensive. More maintenance and long term cost of ownership. No pressure profile, just preinfusion.

I cannot decide! I'm pretty early in espresso journey (got the Flair 3 months ago) so still learning what I like, but I'm confident enough I want to stick with it to be willing to invest. I want to get something that I can grow with for a long time and not have regrets or upgradeitis again. I'd lean towards the Elizabeth, but I really did enjoy the manual experience and feel it would not be as fun to hit a button and get coffee. But on the weekday mornings, sometimes that's exactly what I need...

So I've been having a small issue where I notice my Rancilio Silvia doesn't pump water during extractions. It doesn't happen that often (maybe 2-4 times a week). It usually starts pumping again whenever I turn off the brew switch then back on though. 

Anyway, I started to investigate what could be wrong and noticed there's a small hole that squirts water as the pump starts pumping. It's a small amount, but when I cover it with my finger everything looks fine and water flows as expected. 

What I also noticed is that if I cover the hole, I never have the random issue where my pump stops mid extraction. 

I'm not sure if these are separate issues, but maybe there is some relation here? 

Hoping that maybe someone may know what this issue is, and whether or not I should get a replacement tube if that could be the issue?",espresso,1645202294

919,svli1y,SidewardMaster98,"Got a French press for Xmas, and I would like to discover some coffee recipes for it","Hello everybody!

&amp;#x200B;

As people usually say, I've received this coffee press on Christmas, or French press. I received it from one of my grandmas since they usually don't leave a receipt, and I cannot exchange this gift. Besides, I don't really wanna disappoint them since they love to check out whether I use their gifts or not. So, returning or exchanging this gift is definitely not an option for me. Besides, I like that it looks stylish, and it's really amazing that my relatives finally learned what things I might like.

&amp;#x200B;

So, since there is no chance to return this gift, I don't even want to do it. I've decided to google how to brew a coffee in there. Well, the process of brewing coffee seemed pretty straightforward. But, I need to warn you that despite all the simplicity of the process, you still need to play around with it before learning how to make a delicious coffee there. I swear, after a while, I even can't drink a coffee from my old coffee maker. Perhaps, only because it's too old and needs to be replaced eventually.

&amp;#x200B;

So, I thought you could make only one type of coffee using a French press. But, on Instagram, I found different recipes. Well, I can't say that all of them are pretty simple. Besides, many of them require different syrups, which I don't have in my arsenal. They are pretty expensive, though. So, I don't see any point in buying the whole stock that baristas usually use.

&amp;#x200B;

Still, apart from coffee, you can also make different hot beverages. For instance, I am a tea enthusiast. I love to mix different loose tea and add some ingredients, such as orange peels, making the drink more aromatic. It is way easier to brew tea in a French press, and all tea leaves do not go into your cup. I also read somewhere that it is possible to make hot cocoa in it, but my attempts failed.

&amp;#x200B;

So, I would like to ask you if you love to brew a coffee in a French press and what unique and delightful recipes you can share?",espresso,1645200322

I recently bought a Single Dose Hopper from AliExpress (another member here linked it, quite a nice hopper with metal components and a sturdy silicone bellows)

However since using it I think I 'blew' all the easily available grinds out, causing quite a sizable retention that I didn't have prior (think because of the exchange?)

I know this might sound strange, but after I blew out the initial leftover grinds my retention actually increased to ~1 gram. I opened it up and definitely on the plastic chute there is some left and regardless of how hard I press on the bellows it will not get out.

The last time I owned an espresso machine was in 1997-1998 and it was a basic, plastic-encased consumer device. Trying to decide whether I should :

A) invest in an ‚Äúend game‚Äù machine (for me) with dual boiler and rotary pump while keeping my 1zPresso Pro; 

B) get a ‚Äúlower end‚Äù HX machine that‚Äôs more affordable and upgrade to the Niche Zero (no guarantee I‚Äôd upgrade the machine); or

C) buy a really nice grinder for pour overs, get a Moka pot, and get the machine in the distant future.

Current context:
Work 70 hrs/week with limited time to dive into the rabbit hole. 

Have two young children (infant + preschooler) so noise is a concern, as is time, as noted above. 

Own a 1zpresso Pro and Capresso Infinity (gift) for my pour overs. 

Imagine daily usage would include: 1-2 lattes or cortados and 2-3 espressos. 
Weekend matcha lattes (wife doesn‚Äôt drink coffee) and 1-2 steamed oat milks (‚Äúkinderccino‚Äù for the preschooler.) 

I like the idea of quiet machines (rotary pump) that will help me consistently make delicious espresso and make things my family will enjoy (dual boiler). Otoh, I‚Äôm wondering whether I should take a more measured approach - perhaps even waiting until the kids are older to take up this craft. 

If I go end game, the Pro 700 seems like the best match for just under $3k but could easily consider the Bianca. Just like the ‚Äúclean‚Äù design of the 700. I could probably ask for a nice grinder next Christmas. 

If I went HX, I‚Äôd have concerns about the sound in the mornings but could probably get a nice grinder (Niche or otherwise) today. Eventually, I‚Äôm guessing I would want a machine I could entertain with, when that becomes an option.

If I waited on the machine, I could just get my espresso fix on the weekends with a Moka pot or trip to the favorite cafe.

My first step was to do a full cleaning and descaling according to the user manual. My first attempt to pull a shot after that, nothing came out of the spout. When I checked the screen of the infuser, it was totally clogged, and after a vigorous scrub had it looking better I gave it another go.

Just starting to get into home made espresso. Machine is a De'Longhi Stilosa, everything used is stock. Super cheap Mr. Coffee grinder. I'm pretty sure the baskets/portafilter are pressurized, and I've read that makes grind quality matter less? Finally got a scale today to try and get ratios and doses right. Started with 17g for a double shot because I heard that was a good start. The double shot basket with this machine (evidently) does not hold 17g. It was likely 15g. I cut it off too late so final pour was actually 40g out, in 11 seconds. Which sounds *way* too fast. I know the advice is to grind finer to slow it down, is that just it? Or am I doing something else wrong?",espresso,1645117127

987,suqvse,_aj077,Bubbles appearing on latte art,"Hi Guys! 

Need your expert opinion on my shot. I've noticed that with some of the coffee I end up having bubbles on top of my crema. Even if I knock it on the countertop and then pour the latte art, I end up having bubbles all over it within a minute or so. So far this only happened with two types of beans - both arabica. In one case the coffee was used 4 weeks after it was roasted and in the other it was 6 weeks.  


What could be the root cause? I grind 20g of coffee to get 40ml of espresso within 30 seconds. I run it on the naked portafilter and it pours just fine, pretty equally and without channelling.   
I use the ECM Classika PID (96C, 9bar) and a eura mignon perfetto grinder.  


Thanks for all your tips!

Recently I signed up for the Trade subscription. They send your order to the roaster every x weeks, and it gets roasted that day and shipped to you. You get a different coffee from a different roaster every time. 
My first two bags were lovely, and there was a date stamped on the package, which showed it was roasted the day/the day before it was shipped. I time my deliveries so I start using that bag about a week after it was roasted, as I‚Äôve heard that if the beans are too fresh, it can get fussy. 

Now, my third bag, there‚Äôs no stamp/written day for when they roasted. I started using it about a little over a week after the day they shipped it. It‚Äôs now about day 15. 

As usual, I just left my grinder in the setting of the last coffee, and adjust is from there. My first shot was super fast, like a waterfall. I‚Äôve gone finer and finer until I had my Sette 270 to as fine as it can go, and it‚Äôs still stupidly fast. I‚Äôm tamping it as hard as I can too. This has never happened to me. 

The coffee is Oren‚Äôs Two Bridges. It‚Äôs a light-medium roast, and I usually go for medium or medium-dark. I know that lighter roasts you need to grind finer, but this is insane! Is this normal for lighter roasts, that the finest setting of the Sette 270 isn‚Äôt fine enough? Do I need to adjust the internal grinder rings so it can go finer? Or could my beans freshness be the problem (too fresh if they did indeed shipped it when roasted, or too stale if they gave me an old bag).

Some of us know it as our morning fuel, or maybe it‚Äôs your special time to experiment with caf√© creations. Some of us though, like myself, know it as the reason we‚Äôre alive.

I‚Äôd probably die without it, literally.

The reason why espresso has become a part of our lives or how large a part it plays is irrelevant here. Maybe you just decided you loved how your local barista made your cappuccino and you wanted to try it at home. Maybe your suspender-man-bun hipster barista friend gave you a shot ‚Äúon the house‚Äù and from then on you were hooked. No matter what your own attraction to it is, espresso is intense, captivating, alluring, and an often mysterious phenomenon that keeps people coming back for more.

Do you have a question about how to use something new? Want to know how many grams of coffee you should use or how fine you should grind it? Not sure about temperature adjustments? Wondering about your coffee's shelf life or the best way to store it? Maybe you‚Äôd just like some recommendations on new gear?

There are no stupid questions here, ask any question and the community and moderators will chime in to help you out! Even if you don‚Äôt actually know the answer to a question someone asked, don‚Äôt be afraid to comment just so you can participate in the conversation.

We all had to start somewhere and sometimes it‚Äôs hard figuring out just what you‚Äôre doing right or wrong. Luckily, the r/Espresso community is full of helpful and friendly people.

You can still post questions as an official post if you feel it warrants a larger discussion, but try to make use of this area so that we can help keep things organized in case others potentially have similar questions.",espresso,1645041616

I would love to save counter space but I also don‚Äôt want to waste time dialling in as ideally my mornings would consist of at least one espresso and one (V60) pour over.

My question is which would you choose, Baratza Sette 270 or Baratza Vario? and why?

Also, I‚Äôm used to weighing and single dosing into the hopper, does getting the weighing versions matter or will I care less about it later?

2) rewired some cables and hoses inside which were tightly wrapped around vibrating parts
3) stopped the cups on top of the machine to rattle

&amp;#x200B;

I must say, from starters, that I'm a newbie when it comes to espresso or coffee accessories, and I'm still exploring for my perfect blend. I switched to a coffee machine a few months ago to celebrate my divorce. Until now, I drank coffee mainly when leaving the house at the coffee shop or used a french press. My wife wasn't a coffee lover, and if the whole world enjoys its aroma, she hates it. And after we had covid, she became even more sensitive to smells. The coffee press I ordered was only used for matcha and herbal teas. After moving out, the coffee machine was my first purchase.

&amp;#x200B;

I dug for a grinder online, and I found these two models that suit my wallet. The only flaw I encountered is that they're made from plastic, but I can deal with that. They're almost the same price, and I don't see any differences between them. I saw people here praising the Baratza grinder, but the price doesn't make it attractive. I didn't reach the level of such a coffee expert yet to spend more than $200 for coffee devices. 

&amp;#x200B;

I understand that a good grinder should cost more, but the DeLonghi machine I bought for less than $200 does its job flawlessly, so I thought a cheaper coffee grinder would also work in my case. I considered buying a manual burr, but I believe that I'll start cursing my choice after using it for a few days. 

&amp;#x200B;

Please, don't be mean to a person who didn't know about the existence of a tamper and a frother until recently, but simply help me with the choice. If these two models aren't worth it, please advise something else in the same price category.

&amp;#x200B;

And if someone here bought a Capresso or a Mueller device, please share your opinion. I'd like to know about your experience using these grinders. Any other recommendations will also be highly appreciated. Thanks.",espresso,1645022255

Now I (normally?) only have the money to upgrade either one at the moment - so I was curious about your opinion and whether I should still upgrade and wait for the grinder first - to match the machine later (as the general rule of thumb says), or If  it's just fine to go for the Bezzera right now.

After cleaning that up I recalibrated the zero position per the YT video one of you posted. Now I have a fine consistent grind for a good shot.

The only issue I am having now is steaming. It is weak. When  I remove the tip of the steamer I see a clear rubber gasket around the thread. Is that enough to seal it, do you think there might be a leak that I cannot see? Should I use one of those gas tapes on the thread?

I'm looking to upgrade my grinder situation, for use with my Flair Signature. I'm somewhat new to espresso, having upgraded from a gifted DeLonghi EC155 to the Flair, but am quickly becoming obsessed. I have a Baratza Encore that I've modded to go finer, but I still find that the adjustability is still not quite precise enough, and I'm occasionally at the absolute finest setting with certain beans/roasts. My hope is to look for a used non-manual machine to upgrade to, since I am in no real rush to do so. What might you guys suggest is conceivable to find used for under $400? 

I don't consider a manual grinder an option, since I make espresso for guests often, and I'm hoping for an all-purpose grinder, since I do enjoy french press, pour overs, and cold brews made at home as well. I roast my own beans and enjoy experimenting.

 From my searching, I've found these, but would love other suggestions.

At first, I thought I was having poor extractions due to grinding too fine because no water was being let out during the extraction, however, even when I grinded coarser I noticed that sometimes the same thing would happen... no espresso comes out. 

Then I decided to look at the water hoses in the back during extraction to see if water was being drawn from the reservoir and it seems like nothing is happening back there. 

With the portafilter in, the water from the hoses does not pump - sometimes it doesn't pump at all and sometimes it does, but when the portafilter is out the water flows as expected.

So I've been pulling 18g doses on a 20g VST basket for a few weeks now with different beans with success. The fact that I was using a larger basket size than my shot was bothering me for no reason and I wanted to try a 18g IMS basket just because I've read that is what you're supposed to do (use the same basket and dose size).

Since I changed to the 18g IMS basket (and coffee beans) my shots have been very strange, first they pulled really slow, like in 50-60 second range and tasted really sour. As I started to grind coarser of course it would pull a bit faster but I would get tremendous channeling and spurting in the 40-50 second range. This morning I pulled coarser and had like 8 different channels and achieved a 30 second pull. the shot tasted bitter. Should I go the other the other way and grind finer again until the shot ""looks"" like a normal espresso shot (a few drops at first and then a main middle channel) even if it pulls in a long time?

I am almost certain that it is the basket the one that is affecting the most since the beans are a month old at max from a local roaster. I could just go back to the 20g VST since that was working for me before the change.

1127,st2l8h,lkocman,Eureka Mignon Single Dose as external grinder for my Sage Oracle. Both wife and me are happy :-),"I just got an external grinder for my Sage Oracle. What's the benefit?

I do like the machine, my wife can dial in easily, we're both super happy about the consistent milk froth it auto-produces with zero effort. Milk drinks are simply amazing.

The downside for people who care and want to enjoy espresso is the grinder, where you want to stick medium-darker roasts only.

Just to say that my wife is not really into experiments, she goes only for cappuccino, has favorite coffee beans. Two shots a day and she's happy with it. I'm on the opposite spectrum where I don't mind a bit of acidity and would drink mostly espressos and then light roasts V60 for larger volumes. With espressos, I'd prefer lower doses than what Oracle does as I have around 7 coffees a day on average.

If you start to experiment with medium or in general lighter roasts, you'll soon start to see issues with the single basket, you'll have lots of waste and you'll simply give up and will work with double basket only. And this is not a very economical, and also very wasteful process.

Well and here go the pros of getting a good external grinder that will help you overcome challenges especially with lighter roasts.

&amp;#x200B;

The big win of this combination is that she can have her favorite beans in the built-in grinder at static settings with 25/30sec presets (single/double). I can freely experiment with the single-dose grinder without affecting her workflow (well just be careful about mixing baskets in case you have a single portafilter).

I just made a few shots with a single basket with coffee beans that were a problem for a single basket and built-in grinder and I'm enjoying the difference of developed flavors. That was simply not possible with the single basket before. 

So single machine and both of us can produce decent coffee, we just have completely different workflows.

My wife could probably never ""comfortably"" operate something more manual than Oracle, or could but would get instantly turned off, especially if she'd have to wait 20 minutes to heat up dual boilers etc. I set it up at 5am when she was up, so the machine is ready when she needs it. Therefore my setup is a really good tradeoff for priorities that we both have.  

I recommend this or a similar setup for those who have respect for the partner who would simply be lost with a fully manual setup and perhaps want to rely on the machine to do consistently all the amazing milk prep while preparing breakfast for kids etc, that is good enough for you to pour latte art and focus on the espresso. That's definitely where this setup fits in.

Let me know if you're thiniking of something similar.

1130,st0709,legendary_unitato,DF64 2 Weeks Later - So Close,"So I've had the DF64 for about two weeks and just wanted to share my experience with it for those looking to buy one in 2022.

Rentention is still an issue, the silicone flapper is too stiff even after revision so I did the DIY mythos style mod with a thin sheet of plastic and a 3D printed spacer. With the mod, retention is reduced to about 0.2g and almost 0 with RDT and bellows. Static is not an issue for espresso but is pretty strong at medium grind size, you will need RDT or it'll make a mess. The dosing cup doesn't have much static despite being made of plastic though. 

Build is surprisingly solid, much heavier than it looks.  Some people say it looks plasticy but it's actually all metal, even the lid which is a surprise. 

Taste, coming from a Mignon MK1, is a massive improvement both before and after the flapper mod. The Mignon was super clumpy and produced more fines and shots always had some slight bitterness that lingered which was unpleasant even in an otherwise great shot. With the DF64, the bitterness is completely gone and I couldn't see any sediments at the bottom of my cups, shots have great clarity and and sweetness but have slightly less body. I also noticed I could grind quite a bit finer without choking my machine.

Overall I personally think the DF64 offers incredible performance for the money and if you are willing to take it apart to mod it's way up there with the best and there's still the option to upgrade to SSP burrs. However I still consider the Niche to be the king in this price bracket. Yes it's $100 more expensive but doesn't require modding and looks better in my opinion its only weaknesses are availability and depending on who you ask, conical burrs (not an issue for me).",espresso,1644921841

1160,ssld99,LiberalTheory,Is a Nespresso right for me?,"I'm a law student who loves very, very strong coffee and happens to be very, very broke.  Been drinking Folgers without milk or sugar since I was a teen, and I recently have discovered a love for Turkish and Cuban coffee.  I've never had an espresso however until recently.  I visited my sister and she served me on her new Nespresso and I tried it out of curiosity, and I absolutely loved whatever she gave me.  So much that I asked for two more shots after that!  

So my problem is that I don't have a lot of spare change.  I've been doing my research for the last few months, and concluded I simply cannot afford to invest $600+ in a proper espresso setup up front plus cost of getting the coffee itself.  As part of my research, I've been exploring my local cafes and coffee stores trying espressos there.  I've liked most of them bust admittedly some espresso I've had from a few cafes have been quite bad, but the main problem is that they're all at least $3.50 when a Nespresso pod is less than a dollar.  Ideally, I would like to not even use the pods at all, which is why I've been scouting shops to find espresso I like that I can buy from to put in a reusable pod myself.  Trouble is it seems that the only truly environmentally friendly pods are the stainless steel ones, but they seem to have a habit of wearing down and destroying the Nespresso itself which isn't good.  Nespresso's ""recycling"" program is a joke once you add up the carbon emissions from bringing the pods to the UPS store and then them running them back to Nestle, just to maybe end up reused or maybe end up in a river somewhere.

I know, Nespresso isn't ""real"" espresso.  But it's close enough, and I know I like at least one type of coffee they have.  Also, I don't see any reason why I can't just get freshly ground local espresso beans that I like from a local roastery and put them in old pods that I can reseal with aluminum stickers for a few times so I can both get better coffee out of them and also reduce the waste caused by the pods.  

Or is there some other option here that I'm missing?  I do plan to upgrade to a real espresso machine eventually but I won't be making money until next year so I need a fix in the interim to get me out of my Target brand coffee drip machine rut.",espresso,1644872724

While the machine served us well, I would like to move to something else meetings this requirements:

**- Decent coffee, but mainly cappuccinos**. We make \~20/week, the quality of the Philips was fine at the beginning but just got worse with time. I would like something closer to a proper coffee from a bar now though.

**- Convenience.** I don't mind tinkering a bit more (work from home), but my girlfriend wakes up very early in the morning and needs something quick and clean.

**- Durability.** I don't want another machine that breaks in 2-3 years without fixing options, so planning to buy a little bit more term.

Considering this I am almost decided for a **Lelit Elizabeth** \+ **Eureka Specialita +** smart plug for auto start**,** mainly three reasons to pick this:

\- The ability to time everything, the plan is to dial in and configure both grinder and shot timers and don't think about it on a daily basis. 

\- Dual boiler, so we can just put the portafilter on, start the timer and steam the milk in the meantime. In a couple of minutes we can have a cappuccino ready.

\- Seems good quality and durable.

The only thing I don't like is the water tank... I won't have much space on top of the machine and I am not sure how I will refill. How often do you usually refill the tank while doing 3-4 coffees a day? 

My main question is whether this approach will work. We won't get the perfect shot every time, but will relying on the timed shots produce decent cappuccinos (i.e. better than the super auto?)? On the weekends I might spend a bit of extra time to get a nicer shot and let it dialled in again for the week. 

My alternatives are:

\- **Breville Oracle:** more convenient but a bit worried by the comments about the grinder being subpar for the machine... and in terms of durability the Lelit looks better. 

\- **Breville Bambino + Specialita:** very different approach, but way cheaper and it has the auto steaming which is something we would appreciate.",espresso,1644836363

Putting monin syrup into high quality coffee is like putting bicycle tires on a Ferrari.," I own cocktail bars and we build a lot of syrups from scratch and have been for over a decade. I see a lot of your set ups have monin syrups in the background and figured this was a way I could add my voice around here. That stuff is hot garbage and you can do way better very quickly and for less money. 

First, we really need to discuss simple syrup. I've been to waaaaay too many coffee shops where an iced latte or cold brew is sweetend with thin slightly sweet water. Making a basic simple syrup is 101 and for those of you who are adventurous, hot simple syrup can be infused with just about any spice to flavor hot and cold drinks alike (so add some cardamom or cinnamon, etc and you're off to the races). Also, using true simple syrup allows you to consistently sweeten.  The recipe is:

1 part sugar
1 part hot water
BY WEIGHT! (I know you all have scales)  
Stir until sugar is dissolved

From here you can easily add the spices of your choice (cardamom, vanilla bean, cinnamon, black tea, etc etc) just make sure the syrup is warm and you give ample time for infusion.

Instead of monin orgeat try:

1 part almond milk 
1 part sugar
BY WEIGHT!
3 - 6 drops orange blossom water 
3 - 6 drops rose water 
I like mine with the expressed oils from a few orange twists (not the twists themselveS) 
Blend until sugar and almond milk are incorporated. 
This will seperate over time but just shake it.

Anyway, if anyone is interested in this sort of thing let me know what you're interested in and I'll do a follow up post with more recipes.",espresso,1644789291

1221,srsn4b,zen_in_chaos,What would be the cost (to the manufacturer) of a 'prosumer'-grade espresso machine?,"  


Price Analysis:

A typical retailer in the US sells a mid-tier prosumer-grade machine for about $3000.

\[Example: top of the line Rocket, Quickmil, ECM etc.).

\---

Cost to manufacture: $1000 \[material, labor, factory space, utility, power,... \]

Markup (profit margin 100%): $1000

Distribution cost (%25): $250

Total (Manufacturer sell price to retailers): $2250. ($1000 + $1000 + $250)

Retailer marks up 30-35%(let's say 33.33%) : ($2250 \* 33.33%) = $750

Thus, the List price is approximately $3000 (= $2250 + $750).

Some of us know it as our morning fuel, or maybe it‚Äôs your special time to experiment with caf√© creations. Some of us though, like myself, know it as the reason we‚Äôre alive.

I‚Äôd probably die without it, literally.

The reason why espresso has become a part of our lives or how large a part it plays is irrelevant here. Maybe you just decided you loved how your local barista made your cappuccino and you wanted to try it at home. Maybe your suspender-man-bun hipster barista friend gave you a shot ‚Äúon the house‚Äù and from then on you were hooked. No matter what your own attraction to it is, espresso is intense, captivating, alluring, and an often mysterious phenomenon that keeps people coming back for more.

Do you have a question about how to use something new? Want to know how many grams of coffee you should use or how fine you should grind it? Not sure about temperature adjustments? Wondering about your coffee's shelf life or the best way to store it? Maybe you‚Äôd just like some recommendations on new gear?

There are no stupid questions here, ask any question and the community and moderators will chime in to help you out! Even if you don‚Äôt actually know the answer to a question someone asked, don‚Äôt be afraid to comment just so you can participate in the conversation.

We all had to start somewhere and sometimes it‚Äôs hard figuring out just what you‚Äôre doing right or wrong. Luckily, the r/Espresso community is full of helpful and friendly people.

You can still post questions as an official post if you feel it warrants a larger discussion, but try to make use of this area so that we can help keep things organized in case others potentially have similar questions.",espresso,1644782418

A) they don‚Äôt know what they are selling.
B) they got it second-hand for a low price as well and again, don‚Äôt know the value.

So I guess my questions are: Do you guys know of any ways to skip the cycle, other than running it before the machines prompts it itself?

My very first machine was the LaPavoni Professional, a lovely little machine, but unfortunately, the build quality didn't impress me after numerous breakdowns. (Post-millennium model.)

So after a few years with the LaPavoni, I added an Elektra Micro Casa a Leva to the collection. After a few years with it, I have to admit that I'm not thrilled with its build quality either. Don't get me wrong; both machines make excellent espresso. When they work.

Now, I'm getting ready to pull the trigger (lever?) and buy a Cremina.

However, I'm still debating whether to go with the classic or the newer SL with a spring.

I genuinely enjoy pulling a shot on the LaPavoni is it is purely a hands-on experience, where you literally get out what you put in.

On the other hand, the spring ensures a level of consistency that is tricky to achieve with a manual lever. 

Yes, I know I could install a smart profiler on the Cremina, track all metrics, and thus ensure consistency. But I'm not thrilled about compromising the aesthetics of the gorgeous Cremina with a blob on top of the group head.

By stopped working, the pressure release mechanism is failing and not working anymore. No matter how much I turn the lid, the pressure will not get released. 

I reached out to Fellow when it first happened and now again, but still didn‚Äôt get a reply back for both cases. I‚Äôm sure they will handle this properly and send me replacement parts or something.

However, the reason I am posting this is just to warn people of the quality control on these. Before purchasing this, I saw many posts on this sub of people complaining about the same issue. These posts dated back to 3 month ago and many mentioned that Fellow had a faulty production batch. So I was like this was 3 months ago, of course they have this fixed by now. Unfortunately, that is not the case and I did order these products directly from their website. 

Anyways, if anyone is interested in this product, I wouldn‚Äôt recommend getting it, both pieces I ordered stopped working after 1 week. This rate is too high to call it a one-time issue. I would recommend waiting till Fellow sorts this issue out or look at other alternatives.

So I hope this is the correct sub for this question.. I'm looking to get a stepless grinder (Eureka Specialit√°). And I've been trying to figure out exactly how to dial this in, and I find that much information online is very vague or conflicting..  


My first concern is that I start too fine, the blades will hit each other and I end up with a broken motor or chipped metal? - However, some guides online seem to suggest that I find my 0 point, by going finer and finer, until I hear the blades slightly hit each other?   


Can someone please explain this to me? Or maybe point me in the direction of some great sources? I've not been able to find anything, I find very trustworthy..

Cliff and Pebble Experience,"I made a decently sized order with Cliff and Pebble in early January for a Rocket R58, a Eureka Mignon, and some accessories. Right at about $4k total purchase. It was all promised to ship out in 1 day, however, I went a week without receiving any shipping notifications. I was calling and using the chat and received lots of excuses, like the warehouse is backup up, it will ship out tomorrow, and all that. The best was when I called and they told me the tech just put it in the box to ship it out, but once I hung up, I noticed it had actually be delivered while I was on the phone. I had just never received the shipping notification or tracking info.

To their credit, they refunded my $150 in accessories for the ordeal. 

Now on to the machine. The R58 was obviously opened before I received it. It was said to 'check it out'. Since owning it, I have had nothing bot issues. Leaks from the brew group, a water tank that has to be propped just right or the machine senses an empty tank, and now, the hot water wand won't build pressure and will not work. I called service any they redirected me to another company 'Chris Coffee' who directed my to the service manual and told me to try and replace a few parts. Is this what $3200 and a 3 year 'warranty' gets?

So I called to return the machine and they say, nope, you are 2 days over the 30 day return period, from when you placed the order. Not factoring the more than a week it took me to get the machine.

Some of us know it as our morning fuel, or maybe it‚Äôs your special time to experiment with caf√© creations. Some of us though, like myself, know it as the reason we‚Äôre alive.

I‚Äôd probably die without it, literally.

The reason why espresso has become a part of our lives or how large a part it plays is irrelevant here. Maybe you just decided you loved how your local barista made your cappuccino and you wanted to try it at home. Maybe your suspender-man-bun hipster barista friend gave you a shot ‚Äúon the house‚Äù and from then on you were hooked. No matter what your own attraction to it is, espresso is intense, captivating, alluring, and an often mysterious phenomenon that keeps people coming back for more.

Do you have a question about how to use something new? Want to know how many grams of coffee you should use or how fine you should grind it? Not sure about temperature adjustments? Wondering about your coffee's shelf life or the best way to store it? Maybe you‚Äôd just like some recommendations on new gear?

There are no stupid questions here, ask any question and the community and moderators will chime in to help you out! Even if you don‚Äôt actually know the answer to a question someone asked, don‚Äôt be afraid to comment just so you can participate in the conversation.

We all had to start somewhere and sometimes it‚Äôs hard figuring out just what you‚Äôre doing right or wrong. Luckily, the r/Espresso community is full of helpful and friendly people.

One thing is still quite a massive question mark for me tho: How do I decide when to adjust my recipe and when to adjust my grind?

So far (not looking into turbo shots yet) basically I try to start to dial in by trying to get to 1:2 in 25 seconds, and adjusting grind size in small steps from there until sour and bitterness are balanced out. (Mostly I end up on the finer side with closer to 30-35 seconds so far, but I didn't have great, fresh beans yet, so I will see how this changes with different beans and roasts.)

Some people say: on this roast I prefer a 2.5, or these beans are better in 1.5 ristretto. But unfortunately I never heard anyone explain WHY they prefer it. What differences in taste and texture am I looking for here? 

And, maybe as a bit more vague question: after balancing sour and bitter, most of the time my shots still don't taste awesome, not as sweet as I want and a bit boring and unpleasant. Is that the fault of the beans, or are there other dimensions to tinker with? (9 bar OPV with 93C temp, PID Lelit Diana, currently on a darkish roast.)

1511,soxho9,Scorosin,"A few quick reviews on some entry level machines, I a beginner have tried.","I only recently got into espresso, and I went through numerous machines in the up to 300-dollar US price range I thought I would share my thoughts on machines I have tried and see if I can help anyone new out. For reference I am using the jx pro manual grinder and a nice medium arabica roast javapresse makes. Not a top-of-the-line coffee or grinder but not bottom of the barrel either I feel most beginners will start with something around this range if they want to get into the door to espresso.

The 3 machines I will be comparing in this price bracket are the delonghi ecp3420, mr coffee one touch coffee house, and the breville/sage Bambino.

first, we will go over price the delonghi ecp3420 is 120-170 us dollars the cheapest machine reviewed, the mr coffee coffeehouse is 300 dollars, the breville/sage bambino is 300 dollars.

Second category is filter baskets the bambino gets extra points here for including non pressurized baskets the mr coffee and Delonghi do not have these.

&amp;#x200B;

Third category portafilter quality, the delonghi machine has an excellent feeling portafilter, the bambino's is too light being made of aluminum and the mr coffee's is the most finicky thing I have ever messed with in my life as you have to screw in the filters and they fall out often it also feels cheap with lots of plastic.

&amp;#x200B;

Fourth category pre infusion the delonghi ecp 3420 is the only machine without a pre infusion cycle to wet the grounds, it loses points for not having the option. (if it does have it, it does poorly as I did not notice it).

&amp;#x200B;

Fifth category steam wand type and usability, The Bambino trumps the other machines in this price range it has a wonderfully powerful steam wand for its price point and with practice will get you wonderful latte's flat white's and cappuccino's. Delonghi offerings at this range have panarello wands which simplify the process of foaming milk though these wands are beginner friendly they leave the end user with virtually no control of the process and are not as suited for all occasions like a traditional wand would be. The upside is however if you only drink cappuccino and do not wish to take the agonizing time necessary to perfect your technique ( I understand believe me.) you can still get a good cappuccino out of them. The mr coffee is rather unique at this price point as it is fully automated during the milk frothing/steaming process/ the user has no control whatsoever but the results are competent enough to be passable especially if you just wake up and want an easy cappuccino or latte, the machine has multiple settings for both and you can fine tune the amount of foam fairly well with the options provided but the process is not nearly as hands on as a proper wand on the plus side though you wont burn yourself with steam when you wake up and grab the metal bit instead of the rubber hand guard like I did. 

&amp;#x200B;

Sixth category filter capacity, the bambino is best in this range due to its 54 mm filter capacity with proper grind size 18 grams and slightly above can fit the machines doubleshot basket well, the delonghi comes second in capacity I am typically able to get 16 grams in with space to spare, and far in third is the mr coffee with only after significant blood sacrifice can fit 13-14 grams well at a fine grind.

&amp;#x200B;

seventh category tampers all of the machines listed come with tampers! (of a sort...) They are all plastic but the edge has to go to the bambino for having a proper tamper and not a flimsy combination tamper/scoop like the other machines reviewed. 

&amp;#x200B;

eighth category ease of use/ slash automation by a country mile the easiest machine to actually brew and froth with is the mr coffee since it is fully automatic, then the delonghi due to its easier to use wand, and lastly the Bambino which is manual frothing, it does have automated 1 cup and 2 cup functions but they are not always an accurate measure and I feel do not put it above the delonghi due to how much simpler frothing is on that machine. 

&amp;#x200B;

Ninth category brew quality, in my opinion if you are willing to put in the work and learn the proper way of making cappuccino and latte the Bambino can produce the best tasting cups and the best milk by a mile, the downside is you have to be willing to carry it that distance to get there, it is not a machine that will hold your hand (in fact I think mine wants to kill me.) but it will produce the best results with practice and good equipment to support it (quality grinder, scale, loader, bottomless portafilter, and filter screen!). The runner up in quality would be the mr coffee honestly in my taste tests problems with the annoying filter baskets aside it's pre infusion and temperature were better than the delonghi despite you not having any control over the process it produces a consistent albeit robotic result nearly every time. Lastly would be the Delonghi I just really, really hate Panarello wands I am sorry, the espresso it produces is okay but like the mr coffee it is pressurized baskets. So, the Bambino has it beat there, the Mr coffee also froths better even though you have no control it can make a latte that is not half foam panarello's struggle to do that unless you remove the wand and use the little rubber nub and that is a modification and a whole other can of worms I am not opening.

&amp;#x200B;

Tenth category value for money, all of the machines reviewed are entry level and in terms of cost the delonghi should take the cake, but I just feel that it is not worth it compared to the other two, it is more manual than the MR coffee, it is less controllable or moddable than the bambino and it just does not excel in any category other than price. Both the other machines cost twice as much I am aware of that, but the delonghi just feels to me like a steppingstone or a half measure sure it can make okay espresso but with pressurized baskets and no pre infusion it will not be great, and it can froth a good cappuccino but it is not capable to reliably make latte's let alone flat whites.  So in terms of value to a beginner I would have to order it mr coffee, Bambino, Delonghi. 

&amp;#x200B;

Eleventh category cleaning, the easiest machine to clean is the bambino the steam wand an be cleaned easily and the descale process is simple then close behind it is the delonghi which only loses to it because Panarello wands are harder to clean out. The Mr coffee is a misery to clean due to its automated parts and milk container which should be cleaned after every use.

&amp;#x200B;

Twelfth category included accessories, The Bambino barely takes the win over the mr coffee in this one as it includes a proper (albeit plastic) tamp, a milk frothing pitcher (good quality) and 4 filter baskets, the mr coffee comes with 2 cute espresso cups, (they are adorable.) 2 pressurized baskets and a scoop/tamp. The Delonghi is in third it includes a tamp/scoop and 3 pressurized baskets a 1shot 2 shot and espresso pod basket (those things are awful do not even ask.).

&amp;#x200B;

Thirteenth category personal opinion, in my personal opinion the best machine is the Bambino though it can be a love hate relationship (I love it yet it constantly hurts me, like my ex-girlfriend used to.) despite that if you are willing to work at it and invest in your technique with time and dedication you can get amazing results with the Bambino. (Unlike my relationship with my ex-girlfriend.) Second place goes to the mr coffee despite being hard to clean and having a really annoying portafilter its automation and ability to froth reliably put it in second place. It is also not fussy or time consuming to use in the mornings before work so it does gain points for being the easiest morning hurry brewer. Lastly the Delonghi, you can do much worse to be fair, but you can do better if you only save up a little longer it is a fine machine but that is all it is too me it is not as convenient as the Mr. Coffee and it is not hands on and rewarding as a bambino and if there is anything people hate it is mediocrity (or so my ex tells me.) that is its problem it can do many things but it cannot do anything overly well. (we are kindred spirits, I guess.)

This might sound irresponsable, but I‚Äôve been using a Eureka Olympus with Mythos burrs with a PID‚Äôd Gaggia Classic for the past three years while waiting for the perfect espresso machine to come out. I don‚Äôt see my budget expanding to fit a GS/3 or Slayer any time soon and don‚Äôt regret my purchase.

Anyway, my municipal water is pretty hard (300+ ppm tds, &gt;40ppm Ca, &gt;124ppm carbonate) with fairly high chloride (&gt;30ppm) which as I understand it rules out using WAC softening. Someone here has probably made a guide on putting together an RO system that can output adequate pressure for plumbed in machines, but I‚Äôm not really sure where to look. I‚Äôd appreciate if someone could point me in the right direction.

Waited and waited and waited. It arrived and wasn‚Äôt quite dead on arrival. Just wouldn‚Äôt detect weight. Contacted seller then waited and waited and waited (Chinese new year, fair enough). 

They refunded which is great.  Then I started my search all over again and decide I wanted the Timemore black mirror nano. But anywhere is selling it for $210-$250 (Canadian). That‚Äôs crazy. It‚Äôs the same circuitry as the black mirror just in a smaller form factor.  I think everyone‚Äôs trying to price it in the Acaia price range, but it doesn‚Äôt compare in features and functionality.  And nobody has them in stock. 

Went back to the Ali store and they‚Äôre selling it for $99 and claim to have them in stock. I‚Äôve been disappointed once by them and I know I‚Äôm taking a chance, but I think it‚Äôs worth the gamble. Worst case, it‚Äôs another dead unit and I‚Äôll get a refund.

1516,sovjjz,Sarfanadia,Help with purchase,"Hey Everyone,

I am looking into purchasing my first espresso machine. I was interested in the Breville Bambino, but after seeing and messing with the display model at Bed Bath &amp; Beyond I wasn‚Äôt as excited about the purchase. 

The biggest problem was its lightness combined with how hard it was to get the portafilter locked in place. I had to basically force the Bambino to not move while I wrestled to get this thing locked in. 

Is this a common issue with the machine, or is it maybe an issue with that specific display model?

I am a little lost on what to do next. I planned on getting a 1zpresso jx pro and the Bambino; but now I‚Äôm wondering if it is worth moving up to the Breville Barista Express even though the grinder may not be as good as some stand alone models. 

This would be my first foray into homemade espresso, and the reason I am wanting to get into this is because I recently spent 3 weeks in Europe where I had the best coffee I‚Äôve ever had. 

Everything in my area sucks in comparison so I figure I can try my hand at it. 

I‚Äôm just looking for some validation that the Bambino and 1zpresso jx pro are worth it or for some guidance towards another machine. 

Also, keep in mind I‚Äôm used to crappy chain coffee and our local coffee spots here aren‚Äôt too great. So I don‚Äôt want to dive into the deep end when I‚Äôm not sure it‚Äôs worth it.

I‚Äôm currently looking to upgrade my SGP to something nicer with lower retention. I‚Äôve narrowed it down to the Mignon Facile with a single dose mod for a flat option and the 1Zpresso J-Max for a conical. I typically brew one espresso and one filter coffee every day. My question is, if I were to go with the Mignon, would I be able to switch from espresso to filter and back again while keeping my shots dialled in or is the adjustment knob not precise enough for that? Having to dial in once a day would definitely be a deal breaker for me.

grinder: commandante with red clix upgrade  
beans: [irvingfarm.com](https://irvingfarm.com), [partnerscoffee.com](https://www.partnerscoffee.com/), [counterculturecoffee.com/](https://counterculturecoffee.com/), i usually get them in wholefoods with groceries, 3-4 weeks from roasting. keeping them in fellow atmos vacuum canister.

i think i understand the basic idea of dialing - dose, grind level, etc. i can take my shots from bad to good. the problem is taking them from good to great. i also struggle a bit with consistency even after i have found a satisfying recipe.

i can see 3 things i can try focusing on:  
1. better / more expensive beans, maybe try a subscription with some roasters.  
2. invest money into better/different equipment.  
3. focus more on my tasting and dialing skills

which direction do you think i should go?",espresso,1644385335

1595,snzn7a,FluffaLuppagols,To flow control or not to flow control (Mara X),"After doing months of research on a new espresso machine, I‚Äôve narrowed it down to purchasing the Mara X. 

As a newcomer to the home barista world, I was dead set on purchasing the Bambino Plus (automatic frothing was a bonus for my spouse), but I could never get it on sale at BBB. Then I got deeper into the rabbit hole and found that the longevity of the unit is short. So I‚Äôm hoping to future proof myself from any heartache when it eventually dies, and I landed on narrowing down to the MaraX. I considered the GCP, but I‚Äôm not interested in tinkering and modding. 

Purchasing from Chris Coffee, I could get the unit preinstalled with the Flow Control, but obviously it‚Äôll remove the preinfusion capabilities. Though, I could just do manual preinfusions when I get the hang of it and keep the flow control open all the way.

I‚Äôve looked at every post on here and the home barista forums about the flow control on the Mara X and I‚Äôm not finding any information on the pros and cons for users like myself. 

The question is, as an entry level home barista, should I even consider opting out of the flow control until I can get a better handle on the machine and dialing in? In the future, I‚Äôd love to have it and try turbo shots. I‚Äôm just on the indecisive fence right now.",espresso,1644366743

I started a new job and have to wake up at 4:30am PT. Wife has now mentioned that she hates the sound of my grinder. So I played along by saying ‚Äúif you hate it so much, I can just get a new one!‚Äù. Boom, green light.

Needs: Quiet, grind consistency, low profile (nothing much bigger than Sette)

I haven‚Äôt been a single dose kind of guy to know the benefits. I fill hopper every few days, grind, weigh, WDT, brew, enjoy.

I‚Äôm leaning on Niche from everything I searched for but it doesn‚Äôt really seem like a huge upgrade. 

Are flat burrs something I should target?

Id like to keep things under $1,200

Options in my mind:

1)Pay for new grinder as it will be quieter for my wife and more enjoyable for me

2)Tell my wife how much a new grinder actually is and keep the Sette

1652,sndrpi,phsokr,Comparing Dual Boiler and Hx E-61 based design,"If I understand machine design properly, the only (biggest) difference between a Hx and DB design in a E-61 machine is that the DB is free to set the brew and steam boilers at whatever temps the person wants, whereas the Hx always keeps an offset difference between the water available to the brew head and the water in the steam boiler.

Further, the E-61 brewhead is warmed by a thermosyphon. The DB is circulating the brew water to the brew boiler. The Hx is circulating the brew water back to the single boiler (or back into the Hx tube?).

When the Hx machine is sitting for a while, the claim is that the thermosyphon (slowly circulating) water overheats the brew head - and a pre-flush to lower the brew head temperature is recommended. Manufacturers of PID based machines say this pre-flush is (no longer) necessary (it says so right in my User Manual).

I understand that the PID can keep the single boiler rock steady in temperature while the machine idles. But needing a pre-flush is caused by what? The 10 degree oscillations of a PressureStat control system or the physics of a thermosyphon circulatory system compared to boiler water drawn through the brew head? If it is the former then a PID Hx machine (with a 1 degree variance) doesn't need a pre-flush and, if the temp offset between the brew and steam is okay, the DB holds no advantage. However if it is the latter then the manufacturers are overly optimistic with their Hx PID marketing claims and the Hx will always suffer temp drift from idling and need a pre-flush.

Do I understand this correctly?",espresso,1644303316

I know for sure that the Flair can pull better shots than the Silvia once you get the hang of it due to the pressure profiling. But the Rancilio would be a cleaner setup because of the steaming being built in and not having to micro manage your shot pressure.

I have a few machines I'm looking at but can't make a decision between them. I'd prefer single dosing as I usually get different beans whenever I finish a bag. Also would like something quiet but noise isn't a deal breaker. I wanted something that can do filter and espresso, as I also use my Moccamaster and V60 often, but again not the end of the world, but I'd like to save the counter space if possible

**Niche Zero** - single dose, doesn't take u much counter space, but I'm leaning towards flat burrs

**DF64** - cheaper than the P64, has flat burrs, but I just thing it's really ugly and I got my Mara X over a BDB in part because of aesthetics

**Baratza Vario** - boasts it can do espresso and filter. Has flat burrs, but they're ceramic unless I get the W+. I also hear great things about Baratza's customer support so that's definitely a plus. This is the one I'm leaning towards despite it not being a single dosing grinder

I'm thinking about keeping my K-Plus for dark/medium roasts if I get a flat burr grinder as from my research it seems like you lose body with flat burrs.

I am using
Breville Dual Boiler
Breville Smart Grinder Pro
Both are around 4 years old now

Recipe I am aiming for 
Volcan azul bean (a touch over 2 weeks from roast date) a rather light roast
19.5g dose
45g yield
25-30s

My issue is it is constantly extracting too fast and I have seen no change no matter how fine I grind.

So I deep cleaned my grinder. It got worse! It is extracted at a 1:2.5 in about 16s included pre-infusion. Also my pressure has dropped to 5 bars (my machine has never done that before)

I am assuming I am prepping my puck wrong but not sure how as I haven't changed anything.

Alternate thought. Has anyone had clumping issues with the SGP? I am using a WDT tool to break them up. Is this causing channelling? 

I am feeling so lost",espresso,1644271553
1674,sn1ryf,Skraxy,First Espresso Machine Recommendations,"Hey all!

***This'll probably end up being fairly long as I've done a ton of research, just hesitant on pulling the trigger.***

Who Am I?

I am a 19-year-old in the United States looking into purchasing an espresso machine. I have been purchasing a latte (normally iced) almost every single day for the past 180 days and at about $5 a latte, I probably could have purchased a respectable espresso machine grinder setup by now.

What am I looking to spend?

This is a relatively variable number, but I'm probably hoping to spend in between $1000 to $1500 on an espresso machine and a grinder. I am not really worried about the grinder, as I essentially have my heart set on a Eureka Mignon Silenzio just because of the quiet operation. That essentially makes my espresso machine purchase between $500-$1000.

What am I looking for?

This is where I need your help. I am pretty accustomed to...not-so-great espresso. Places that don't level their grounds before tamping are kinda my home territory so I don't know what exactly I'm going to need in order to have a generally pleasant experience.

* PID probably isn't necessary and it'd most likely be a nice-to-have, rather than a must-have. Obviously, things like a standard size basket are necessary for me. 
* Another thing (it may seem odd to some) is it needs to have a lever switch for power. I will most likely have this connected to a smart switch so that in the mornings, I can have the machine turn on a little earlier than when I am ready to start brewing so I get a better result. The lever switch appears to be the only way to achieve this, but correct me if I'm wrong.

Some espresso machines that I have looked into:

* Gaggia Classic Pro is obviously a well-known option but I don't want to be extremely bottlenecked. The good news is that I should hopefully be able to add a PID if need be. Something I like about this one is its reliability and reparability.
* Rancilio Silvia is also a well-known option, similar pros to the GCP, but what are some things that make the Silvia better than the GCP for me? Will it grow with me more?
* Lelit Victoria definitely doesn't share the pedigree that the GCP and Silvia do, but appears to be a very formidable option. This does have nice creature comforts such as PID temperature control and a brew pressure gauge, but is it worth the $1100 price tag for a single boiler machine? At that point, the Lelit Elizabeth and Silvia Pro become options (even if I have to spend more money, it'll be for a dual boiler machine).

So, with all of this being said, are there any options that stand out better than most?",espresso,1644269986

Some of us know it as our morning fuel, or maybe it‚Äôs your special time to experiment with caf√© creations. Some of us though, like myself, know it as the reason we‚Äôre alive.

I‚Äôd probably die without it, literally.

The reason why espresso has become a part of our lives or how large a part it plays is irrelevant here. Maybe you just decided you loved how your local barista made your cappuccino and you wanted to try it at home. Maybe your suspender-man-bun hipster barista friend gave you a shot ‚Äúon the house‚Äù and from then on you were hooked. No matter what your own attraction to it is, espresso is intense, captivating, alluring, and an often mysterious phenomenon that keeps people coming back for more.

Do you have a question about how to use something new? Want to know how many grams of coffee you should use or how fine you should grind it? Not sure about temperature adjustments? Wondering about your coffee's shelf life or the best way to store it? Maybe you‚Äôd just like some recommendations on new gear?

There are no stupid questions here, ask any question and the community and moderators will chime in to help you out! Even if you don‚Äôt actually know the answer to a question someone asked, don‚Äôt be afraid to comment just so you can participate in the conversation.

We all had to start somewhere and sometimes it‚Äôs hard figuring out just what you‚Äôre doing right or wrong. Luckily, the r/Espresso community is full of helpful and friendly people.

1687,smxhjk,TheWeirdestWeasel,Grind speed effects in extraction,"TL;DR: See title. 

I have a coffee bean which I already dialled in at roughly 16gm in, 32gm out in 30 seconds. 

Woke up yesterday, pulled a shot as I usually do, came as expected. 

Now for the interesting part. A friend of mine was visiting. I was showing him my current setup (Breville Dual Boiler + Jx-pro), and he was interested in the grinder. I loaded it with 16gm of coffee and passed it to him so he could try it. He ground the coffee, passed the grinder back to me, I prepped the puck as I usually do, and the shot choked.   


I raised my left eyebrow, loaded the grinder again with 16gm, ground the coffee myself, prepped the puck, pulled a shot, came up alright.   


The only difference between the 2 shots was the grind speed. I usually grind at, say, 3 turns per second, and I hold the grinder in the air. My friend was grinding way slower, at, say, around 1 turn per second or maybe less, and held the grind steady.   


After my friend left, I kept thinking if it was just a coincidence, or something that I could replicate. So I woke up this morning, loaded the grinder with 16gm of coffee, put it on the counter, and started grinding at around 1 turn per second. Prepped puck, pulled a shot. It choked.  
I raised my right eyebrow, loaded the grinder again, did my grind as usual (faster, holding grinder in the air), shot came fine.   


This is not backed by science so YMMV etc, but I wonder if anyone here has experienced anything similar.

I have a ten year old VBM DD V3 and it seems the PID has blown up again.  Nothing is heating up and the display is just flickering a ""U"". The  PID's black plastic case is a little melted. Taking it out, everything  looks fine and the capacitor hasn't blown out.  
 

The ribbon cable was burnt, so hoping for a long shot I replaced that and no change.  
 

Now it seems I can't buy a VBM PID anymore (I'm in Canada)... that said,  paying $300 for something that probably costs $5 to makes me a little  angry. After doing some research, it seems I can simply replace it with  one of the generic Chinese PID's like the SYL-2362?

My wife and I always enjoyed medium roasted coffee more than dark roasted coffee. It is as if there is more fruit and chocolate in a medium roast - typically. We never drink espressos. Only cortados and lattes. The other day I tasted a pure espresso, and it was somewhat sour. I always do 18/36, with top temperature. But now I decided to change the ratio a bit, going to 18/44, and it helped. I mean, there is still some sourness to the shot, but not much. And there is never sourness to the shots as soon as we poor milk into them - they always turn out delicate. So my question is, is there a tendency that medium roast coffees easier becomes sour? And am I doing the right thing going from 1/2 dose to 1/2.5? Would I enjoy a darker roast better? (It‚Äôs been years since we bought them - long before our espresso adventure).

1760,sm6kyr,bguy5,Yet another sour(?) espresso debug post,"I've read an insane amount of threads related to sour espresso but am still struggling with my shots - I'm hoping someone can help figure out if I'm struggling to tell **sour** and **acidic** apart. For context, I've only had espresso in Italy and at a machine at work (I believe they use some Umbria beans, can't remember) - none of them tasted like this. I've had regular black coffee at Starbucks that I would sometimes find sour - light and medium roasts I think.

I've been drinking these as a latte and they've tasted great with no hints of sourness.

Equipment:

* Breville Barista Pro (machine + grinder): I understand people might recommend using a better grinder, but it would blow my mind that this machine is only capable of producing absolutely terrible shots
* Coffee(s): [Hot Shot Espresso](https://drinkcoffeedostuff.com/products/hot-shot-espresso),  [Black Strap Espresso](https://irvingfarm.com/products/blackstrap-espresso), Costco sold Lavazza espresso. I ordered the first 2 through [trade coffee!](https://www.drinktrade.com/) to try a variety and be aware of roast dates. I've tried shots from 3-12 days since the roast date

Method:

* Weigh beans (pre and post grind): tried 15g-18g doses. Kept dose consistent while varying grinds
* Weight output in cup: tried 1:2 to 1:3(+) ratio
* Measure time: most were within 25-40 seconds, including a 5 second pre-infusion. Usually would aim for 28-30 seconds, but focussed more on output. Tested up to 50 seconds
* Grinder setting: ranged from 5-15 (varies from machine to machine it appears so probably doesn't help much). 7 and 8 seemed to be the sweet spot for the non-costco beans
* Temp: limited to what the machine lets me do, but since it's sour I've maxed it out to +5. I run a couple empty double shots through the portafilter to preheat, feels warm to touch. I don't do it every time, but I've also tried leaving the machine on for 25 minutes
* Puck prep: used a homemade (cork + needle) tool to ""fluff/stir"" the coffee in the portafilter. Tamped using the included tool, also tried using a distribution tool. I use a bottomless portafilter and 90%+ of the shots show no obvious channeling

Attempts:

* Grind finer: I've gone as far as I can where it would choke the machine, or take 50+ seconds to pour a 1:2 ratio. The setting I use gives me 25-35 second shots including 5 second pre-infusion and then I focus on the output.
* Grind coarser: Shots come out pretty fast (&lt;20s) and sour
* Increase yield: I've let a 15gm input yield a 50gm output, still sour
* Try different beans: This is my next attempt: [9-5](https://revelatorcoffee.com/products/9-to-5) which is a dark roast. I've also ordered [Lavazza Super Crema](https://smile.amazon.com/gp/product/B000SDKDM4/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o00_s00?ie=UTF8&amp;psc=1) since there's only so much coffee I can blow. I will also to get some beans from work where I know what flavor to expect.

Salami technique:

I read about the salami technique today to see if I was able to differentiate under vs over extraction. Is it possible the shot is so under-extracted that even the last bits (35+ seconds) taste sour?

I separated shots every 5 seconds from 10-45 seconds. The first 2 were absolutely horrible (different from the ""sour"" I was experiencing earlier - was more repulsive), the last 2 were watery with no real taste, the middle ones weren't as repulsive as the first 2 but still tasted sour. I could maybe see the last shot be slightly bitter but only if I was really looking for it.

I am in search for a new grinder. Mostly for espresso but also for alternative brewing. My goal is to have a steped grinder. One similar to niche, but with flat burrs. I do change a lot of beans throughout the week as I buy mostly small batches and also for my partner I do brew decaf. So the stepped option is a must. I like it to be versatilein a way that if not single dose to be able to change into one. 

I did consider x54, mignon xl, single dose, but all these are stepless.

The ideal would be if niche created a flat burr version.üòä

Extraction time is 5s PI (fixed, not changeable) + 21s. Taste is not bad, but a bit too intense, probably because of the high pressure.
So how can I reduce the pressure without being able to adjust OPV or applying dimmer mod? I've tried a coarser grind size or less input. But this has less effect on pressure but yields too much output (ratio 1:4) and taste becomes watered, while still being too intense. Into which direction would you go?",espresso,1644147116

It's a De'Longhi EC702 and a Mr. Coffee Burr Grinder. This is a pretty basic setup but it does produce espresso and that's the key right? This was basically to see if we'd stick with the habit. We've been using it about two years. It's all been cleaned recently but the EC702 will need a flush before use because it's been sitting a few weeks now. You get the espresso machine, the grinder, the 51mm stock portafilter holder, a depressurized basket base (common mod, reversible via included spare parts), a pressurized basket base, a ""double"" espresso basket (\~12g), a single espresso basket (\~6g), a De'Longhi 51mm tamper, a MATOW stainless steel portafilter dosing funnel, and the scoop/brush that came with the grinder. You will not get boxes, manuals, coffee, tamping mat, tea, WDT tool, cups, or anything else you might see in the picture. Just the espresso machine, the grinder, the stuff that came with them and a few extras.

Manuals for the espresso machine can be downloaded here: [https://www.delonghi.com/en-us/manual-espresso-machine-ec702/p/EC-702](https://www.delonghi.com/en-us/manual-espresso-machine-ec702/p/EC-702)

I put 18g of coffee and got 55g of espresso with 25 seconds of extraction. It is obviously too fast, but it doesn't taste that bad. I need to slow it down, but grinding finer doesn't seem to be the answer, because it is already very fine. I used my recently made WDT and it didn't do much. 
Maybe my beans are too lightly roasted, could that be it?

Relatively new to this ie abt a year+ hv tried a few different beans/origins but lately been using these good value freshly roasted arabica beans from either Indonesia (Java) or Brazil AA that I buy in 1kg packs. Not particularly high end beans and not too sure of quality but so far both pretty good to my tastes. They are usually medium to dark roast. Im mostly into milk drinks and bn using standard normale ratios of 1:2 - 1:2.5 for a while now and happy with results. 

Been experimenting with these super long lungo shots ie between 1:7 - 1:9 ratio with added milk especially when I need a larger drink to last when traveling. My standard go to volumes wld be abt 18g in 140-150g out in 45s. Wld add 130ml milk and sometimes topup with water anywhere betw 40-100ml. This is generally to fill up my 400ml travel bottle to last me as long as possible. I find the shots pretty interesting get a strong balanced espresso taste (I think) but the bitterness sometimes overly cuts through. Again im new so this is based on my relatively inexperienced tongue.

My question is for these large drinks wld a light roast here theoretically help me get better flavour/balance in my drinks? Or wld it just spoil the shot? Or sld I jus stick to medium roast to be safe (as Im not using particularly high end single origin beans or the like)?

If it makes a difference my setup is a delonghi dedica i got for free (which started this whole crazy journey and accompanying kitchen makeover!) with bottomless PF paired with a DF64 grinder..

1893,sl69gx,PierricSp,Pressure going up normally then down quickly,"Hi,

I've recently switched from a pressurized-filter-only machine (DeLonghi Dedica) to an Ascaso Dream Pid (short version: I wanted thermoblock for the convenience, and this is the one that seems to rival boilers in temperature stability in many reviews; also compact and elegant enough to get the OK from my wife). It's combined with a Baratza Sette 270Wi grinder, which means I have a decent setup for proper espresso, in theory.

Coffee is generally not too bad, even though there's probably much learning curve left ahead of me to really get the best of the premium beans I'm buying. But there is a trend I've noticed, that I can't understand. Since I have a pressure gauge on this machine, I keep my eyes on it (I'm not really knowledgeable about pressure measurement in coffee machines, so I don't know WHICH pressure it measures, but for reference, the pressure is at 0 until the first drops start flowing, then it goes up more or less quickly; once the extraction stops, it falls back to 0 instantly thanks to the 3-way solenoid I think).

Now the problematic trend is that often, the pressure will go up quite high (thanks to a fine grind and generous quantity and tampering), say to 11 bar, and as soon as it reaches peak pressure, it will start going down again quickly, often back to 6  bar within barely 20 seconds. When it's this extreme, the flow matches the pressure observation: the first 2-3 seconds of flow are nice and thin, and then it accelerates. I know this screams at channeling. I can't verify because I don't have a bottomless portafilter. But I'm rather confident I'm filling, distributing and tampering decently.

An important observation is that this varies a lot with the coffee itself. The one I have right now is as extreme as described above: I end the extraction when the timer hasn't even reached 30 seconds, even though the flow started around 7-8 seconds (no preinfusion). The pressure by then is only 6 bar. But on some coffees, I have not observed the same pattern. On yet other coffees, it happens to a lesser extent: the pressure will keep at top level for a few seconds before starting its descent, and will lose only 1-2 bar in total. I've tried playing with grinder settings and quantities, but this doesn't seem to correlate much with the trend, much less than the coffee in any case.

A maybe unimportant observation, I'm not sure, is that the 2nd coffee I draw (even if I let the machine a lot of time to really heat up), has less pressure than the first. With that ""problem"" coffee I have now, if the 1st one starts at 11 bar and ends at 6, the 2nd will start at 8 and end at 4 (and not taste very good!).

What could this be? Am I really so bad that I'm deceiving myself when I think it's not channeling? is there some other mechansim at play here? For reference I'm using the 14g basket, which fits 14g ok depending on the beans, 15g nicely in all cases, 16g ok depending again on the beans (at 16g I start to sometimes get a hanging cake when removing the portafilter, even though before inserting it there was room between the tamped coffee and the top of the portafilter).

Thanks to anyone with ideas on this !

Cheers,

Pierric.",espresso,1644065533

Hello! I am looking into buying a manual coffee grinder and after quite a few hours of research I have decided one of these should be best for me yet I still cant decide. I currently have a Timemore Chestnut C2 and I am looking to upgrade to a grinder that can do both espresso and pour-over well. (More into espresso, but still brewing filter, lets say 60-70% espresso and 40-30% filter).

I love the adjustment system for these grinders, and that's the main reason I am looking into them and not the Comandante C40, also quite faster grinding.

I prefer sweet, clean cups, with a juicy texture and balanced acidity. I think the K-plus gives this flavor profile better but is the 22 micron adjustment fine enough for dialing in espresso (using a flair signature or flair pro 2)? Is the 8.8 micron adjustment of the J-Max so noticeably better for espresso dial in? Does the K-Plus still offer good texture with less fines than J-max? Would the J-Max be muddy or not clean for pour-over due to the fines?",espresso,1644061630

I went over today, spent 2 hours taking the thing apart and check everything that could go wrong.

Budget: ~$300. Ideally under $400. Hard max of $500, and only if I get a good deal on a higher end grinder.

Local: 90401

Grinders I'm considering buying new: 

* [1Zpresso J-Max](https://1zpresso.coffee/product/jmax/) ~$200: I wouldn't mind using a hand grinder since I am used to them. This would be the cheapest option if I buy new, and I really like that it would be a quiet operation. 
* Baratza [Sette 30](https://baratza.com/grinder/sette-30/) or [Sette 270](https://baratza.com/grinder/sette-270/) ~$300: This thing is so loud! That is what's holding me back on this. If it wasn't so loud, I think I would have bought this already. I have a roommate who works until midnight, so she usually gets up around 10am, and I don't want to wake her up with a loud grinder in the mornings. Also open to the Sette 270 at around $400.
* [Urbanic 070s](https://iurbanic.com/070s) ~$300: I saw [Lance Hedrick's YouTube Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1EeJ4qHgSuA), and this seems pretty good. Kinda an unknown brand in the USA, but it seems like a good grinder.
* Turin DF64 ~400 at [Espresso Outlet](https://www.espressooutlet.net/turin-64sd-elr-single-dose-low-retention-espresso-grinder/): This is on the higher end of my budget, but it seems to be a great value
* The Eureka Mignon grinders line. These are also good bang for the buck grinders. I can get a Eureka Mignon Specialita‚Äô for ~450 at [Espresso Coffee Shop](https://www.espressocoffeeshop.com/en/espresso-grinders/55-81411-0-eureka-mignon-specialita--coffee-grinder.html#/1-color-black/46-voltage-110_v/48-set_up-15bl).

I'm having trouble deciding what to purchase. I currently and using a Gaggia Pure with the latte art steam wand and am getting great espresso, but my wife likes milk drinks and it's such a pain to steam milk with, let alone make back-to-back drinks with how small the machine is. It also just doesn't feel like quality (plastic housing) and I'd prefer something more well-built considering I'm going to use it everyday. So I am looking to upgrade. In a perfect world, I'd like to be able to pull a shot and steam at the same time, but I think I'd prefer a stable temp (PID) over having to flush with an HX machine.

Am I better off with a better SB machine like the Rancilio Silvia with a stronger steam wand and adding a PID and just deal with switching between brewing/steaming which leaves room to buy a Niche Zero or am I better off splurging on something like a Profiltec 300 and perhaps buying the red clix mod on my current pourover grinder Comandante C40?

Or should I reconsider HX machines? I hate having to temperature surf my current machine and HX machines seem just as annoying. Please correct me if I am wrong.

Any thoughts would be helpful.

Some of us know it as our morning fuel, or maybe it‚Äôs your special time to experiment with caf√© creations. Some of us though, like myself, know it as the reason we‚Äôre alive.

I‚Äôd probably die without it, literally.

The reason why espresso has become a part of our lives or how large a part it plays is irrelevant here. Maybe you just decided you loved how your local barista made your cappuccino and you wanted to try it at home. Maybe your suspender-man-bun hipster barista friend gave you a shot ‚Äúon the house‚Äù and from then on you were hooked. No matter what your own attraction to it is, espresso is intense, captivating, alluring, and an often mysterious phenomenon that keeps people coming back for more.

Do you have a question about how to use something new? Want to know how many grams of coffee you should use or how fine you should grind it? Not sure about temperature adjustments? Wondering about your coffee's shelf life or the best way to store it? Maybe you‚Äôd just like some recommendations on new gear?

There are no stupid questions here, ask any question and the community and moderators will chime in to help you out! Even if you don‚Äôt actually know the answer to a question someone asked, don‚Äôt be afraid to comment just so you can participate in the conversation.

We all had to start somewhere and sometimes it‚Äôs hard figuring out just what you‚Äôre doing right or wrong. Luckily, the r/Espresso community is full of helpful and friendly people.

You can still post questions as an official post if you feel it warrants a larger discussion, but try to make use of this area so that we can help keep things organized in case others potentially have similar questions.",espresso,1644004817

Background: I have a V6 Silvia, and I'm not really looking for a change there. Going to mod it with a homebrew PID and manometer here in the coming months (super stoked for the community of modders behind it!)

I currently make a lot of French press, but that's been mostly out of habit. I'm looking to make probably 90% espresso , but I need the ability to grind french press/ other filter methods on demand.

And I like the DF64, but the cup/portafilter holder look cheap, and it doesn't look terribly enjoyable to use compared to the high build quality of the other 3.

I started to look at other things that's good for an enthusiast and now I'm in a rabbit hole. Thanks everyone!

Im currently looking at the following:

* Barista Pro - is this the same type of grinder as the express? is it as bad?
* Bambino Plus - reminds me of a Nespresso machine with the ease of use. good for my partner if she doesn't feel like doing much work for her coffee that time.

2089,sjn8qo,flaque8,Is omniroasting a good thing?,"Some roasters categorise their offerings as 'espresso' and 'filter', whereas others only call out the roast level and flavour notes. 

The latter normally claim they use an ""omniroast"" which works well for all brewing methods.

I appreciate they want to let people explore and just follow their tastebuds but... is this the better way for the end consumer? 

It is easier, I believe, from a marketing standpoint, to claim ""my beans work well however you brew them"". You are literally catering for all your consumers with all your products. But, if people were using roast profiles specifically tailored to a given brewing method... wouldn't that mean the omniroast has to be inferior by definition? If I'm only doing espresso, wouldn't I prefer a roast specifically profiled for espresso brewing, rather than a middle-of-the-road one?

For example in [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jgi44zWKjxQ), they discuss how the roast profiles may differ if focusing on espresso vs filter, and how they would recommend to adapt to using the 'other' profile.

By the way, this is intended to be just a discussion - there is no right or wrong, and people can like whatever they want. There are obvious benefits to omniroasts (I for one like to use my beans primarily in espresso but also in filter-style brewing, so works for me!) so this is not an attack on roasters using it.

Been largely happy with the shots from the Elizabeth, though can't help feeling that upgrading the grinder would improve the output even more. 

I generally single dose with the Vario (which I have done for years with no special attachments before realizing it is the hot new trend :) ) and would likely do the same with the Mignon XL, so retention/workflow is important. I was eyeing a Specialita for a while and now see the XL is arguably the one in that line to get. But, of course, at about twice at what I paid for the Vario, deciding if I will notice a difference is the question.

* **March 7th** \- Malt Couture is a comedy beer podcast hosted by [Don't Drink Beer](https://dontdrinkbeer.com/)'s **Alex Kidd** and his co-hosts, comedy writers and performers **Stephen Loh** and **Michael Gabriel**. Every Thursday they explore the best and worst that craft beer has to offer. No question is off limits, as long as you recognize that Barleywine is life. Here's a link to Malt Couture on [iTunes](https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/malt-couture/id1401013623), [Google Podcasts](https://podcasts.google.com/feed/aHR0cHM6Ly9kb250ZHJpbmtiZWVyLmxpYnN5bi5jb20vcnNz), and [Spotify](https://open.spotify.com/show/7botyzXNLw2nNp3kZUiGxr).

* **March 14th** \- I consider him the king of craft beer TikTok with his funny and educational videos on the craft industry. For **Doug Veliky** (TT/IG: beeraficionado Reddit: /u/DougVeliky) it‚Äôs about more than just the latest trend. With an accounting background Doug joined Revolution Brewing (IG: revbrewchicago) in Chicago as the CFO 6 years ago and transitioned to Chief Strategy Officer about a year ago, now overseeing Marketing and Finance. Prior to Rev, Doug spent 8 years at the US‚Äôs largest beer distributor. There‚Äôs nothing about the craft beer world that Doug can‚Äôt speak to!

&amp;#x200B;

* **March 21st** \- **Brett Splinte**r‚Äôs professional life in craft beer began at Surly brewing, as the Director of Technology and Retail (he was employee #24!). He later went on to start Barrel Theory Beer Company in St. Paul, MN and is now the Director of Hospitality for Lift Bridge Brewing (IG: liftbridge) Oh and did we mention he slings the best burgers in Minnesota on the Private Sector (IG: privatesectormedia) food truck. Curious about the challenges starting a new brewery, scaling a local favorite or managing the public image of your brand? Brett‚Äôs your man.

&amp;#x200B;

* **March 30th** \- For the Johnson family of St. Paul, it‚Äôs always been about the beer. In the 1990s, **Scott Johnson** owned All Saints Brands, Inc., a distribution company that¬†helped bring European classics like La Trappe, Tripel Karmeliet, and Pauwel Kwak to Minnesota. Johnson eventually got out of that business, but he‚Äôs always loved beer. It‚Äôs a passion he shares with his wife, Shawne Murphy-Johnson, and his three children, and BlackStack Brewing (IG: blackstackbrewing) was born! Creative Director and brewer (and son of Scott) **Murphy Johnson** will join us to discuss anything and everything about building a new brewery. Scott will likely pop in for your questions about craft beer  before the boom. If you‚Äôre in the Twin Cities area we will be doing this live from the brewery, join us in person for a beer and some food truck favorites!

I've foraged through previous posts and seen way too many Stone, MT, Alesmith, and Ballast Point suggestions. 

Therefore, I am calling all true beer geeks, the level 99 ""I can only tell 4 people a month about this brewery, because I don't want it to get too busy"" drinkers, the gimmie wax tipped or gimme nuthin connoisseur, the patron who prefers a certain brewery because they exclusively play the Locust/Justin Pearson songs.

So, hypothetically speaking, someone put a can of Natty Lite to your head and said, ""List your top tiered true gem breweries of San Diego before they start solely brewing beer smoothies?"" What would you say?

To make it easy: I like WC IPA-IIIPAs (make IPAs clear again), CDAs (make IPAs black again), BiL, BA Stouts, BA Sours (no kettles), a truly proper Pil/Lager, and everything I've had from Horus.

To make it difficult: Not sure where I'm staying, but let's say within a 30mi radius of downtown San Diego. We'll assume transportation won't be an issue.

PS, this post is tongue-in-cheek. You're not ding dongs. Except for one of you, but I shan't mention who it is in order to maintain a high level of tension, paranoia, suspicion, and anxiety.

PPS, I really do enjoy Stone, MT, Alesmith, and Ballast Point. I just have easy access to them.

PPPS, feel free to include bottle shops/taprooms.

PPPPS, I love you. xoxoxox",CraftBeer,1645632871

&amp;#x200B;

I have this school project that involves branding a different flavor of an existing beer. The other beers are based on characters. We choose a mentor. The kind of person you look up to and holds you accountable. Typically that would be a parent or an instructor of some kind. 

&amp;#x200B;

**What flavors or kinds of beers would you associate with a Mentor?** 

&amp;#x200B;

So far we are thinking about a Porter (because its strong, which would reflect the character), with notes of ginger (because of its healing properties). This also would be a barrel-aged beer (to show age and wisdom).",CraftBeer,1645584698

I am by no means an expert in craft beer or craft brewing but in my years of tasting beer I have never experienced something quite like this. The first beer was a rye ipa and while it tasted off I assumed the whiskey taste was coming from the rye and that it was supposed to taste like that. The second beer was a porter and it tasted quite normal. The 3rd was a hefeweizen and that one tasted like a more watered down whiskey beer. The 4th was a rauchbier (my first time trying one) and once again the taste of whiskey was present. The person I was with who ordered different beers did not complain of a whiskey taste. I even had the person try my hefeweizen which they claimed tasted normal to them. Is it possible my palate was messed up somehow? Ive tasted a lot of beers (usually IPAs) and never tasted anything similar. Was it possible my palate was messed up from the rye ipa? Is a rye ipa even supposed to have a whiskey taste to it?,CraftBeer,1645245807

Does anyone know if Sunday is still really, really busy? Anyone here know what time of the day is best to go? Got two little boys in my car so don't want to get there and have to wait too long.

Kind of a shot in the dark but I'm going to be in Orange Beach, AL with some family for an extended weekend later this month.  There is one single brewery in Orange Beach but I noticed that a short drive would get us to a ton more in Pensacola.  

If this were a trip for me I'd hit every single one but since I'll be with family (and not all of them like craft beer/do drink) I thought I'd try to narrow it to 2-3 of the bunch. 

Any must see breweries or stops?  Of the people going there's definitely a lean towards sours/stouts/IPA's but truthfully they will try anything.  I'm a hophead but haven't met a beer I didn't like.

2701,sgf7ae,Shazz91,Please could you kind folk help me recognise what type of light beer I like?,"Hi, 

When it comes to light beers, I'm trying to work out what I should actually be looking for when ordering or browsing to suit my personal tastes - I know what I like but not how to look for it!

So I've sampled alot of different beers (unfortunately not many of them written down) and I've noticed a pattern -

- (This one seems to be a big trend) - most beers I try that are opaque in that I can't see my hand through the actual beer to the other side, or at least sorta cloudy I tend to enjoy! Beers that are clear for some reason I tend not to.

- If the beer has a sort of sharp, pine- like bitter taste, I tend not to enjoy it as much. 

- Equally, beers I enjoy, I feel like using the word thick but these beers aren't ever actually any more resistant to pouring out or are left behind in the glass for example...

I'm hoping some of this makes sense and might immediately bring to mind what kind of craft beers I would enjoy. Some IPAs for example fit this closer than others, yet they might still all be called 'IPA'

Is it simple trial and error or is there a way for me to better guess to pick something I will enjoy?

2793,se8054,sallyslick,Any Tips for New Breweries/Beers?,"Hey everybody! I‚Äôm new to the craft beer scene, about two years in. I‚Äôm from the New York region and have made the trip to Tree House too many times, so I want to expand my palate. Does anybody have any good recommendations for other beers and breweries in New England or nationwide? Or even some beers that I might find at a local beer store? Any and all recommendations are very much welcome!

As for my palate, I tend to prefer exciting and hoppy flavors. But I‚Äôll break it down by categories:

IPAs
My introduction to craft beer began with soft hazies, so I tend to gravitate towards those. Tree House, Other Half, and Root + Branch are all top of the list for me. But I‚Äôm starting to like some bitterness and dank flavors. My top 5 beers are Heady Topper, King Jjjuliusss, Jjjuliusss, Focal Banger, and Very Hazy. I‚Äôm really starting to appreciate West Coast styles and have had Sierra Nevada‚Äôs Pale Ale and Torpedo a bunch. I‚Äôd like to have more beers that mix the two styles, such as Tree House‚Äôs Sap. And I don‚Äôt care for milkshake IPAs.

Stouts
Pastry stouts from Tree House are making me want to explore this style a lot more. I tried this year‚Äôs Goose Island‚Äôs Bourbon Country Brand Stout and enjoyed it more for its incredible balance than anything else. (Also I‚Äôm not sure if buying it unrefrigerated from a Costco impacted its flavor.) 

Lagers
It feels unfair to group all these styles together, but I am so inexperienced with lagers and my taste buds have been so bombarded with hoppy beers that I don‚Äôt give lagers the credit they deserve. The only lager that thoroughly impressed me was Copper Legend, a festbier from Jack‚Äôs Abby. Is there any sequence of beers that might readjust my palate to appreciate lagers like pilsners?

Sours
I haven‚Äôt enjoyed one yet. I‚Äôd like to, but nothing has done it for me.

Thanks for reading if you‚Äôve made it this far. I‚Äôd like to discover new beers and give other breweries the business, so if you have any recommendations, please let me know!",CraftBeer,1643315802

2820,sdepk5,Shades_of_Kayla,Organization for Single Beers in the Fridge?,"Hey y'all!

I am *lucky* enough to have a craft beer store near me that has aisles and aisles of craft beers - *and* they sell them in single cans/bottles adjacent to their 6-pack version. So when I head out on a beer run, I pick up like 50 singles - and one six-pack - then make it back to my home to find a verifiable mess of beer in my refrigerator. (My enjoyment of craft beer is definitely in trying new flavors.)

I don't have the space (thanks studio apartment) for a separate beer fridge. So all of the beer has to co-exist with all of the food. 

This mostly leads me to make a couple of rows of beers, all different types all jammed in there. If I'm extra-motivated, there might be a line of ""lager"" or a line of ""stout"". 

Problem is, a couple of weeks later, a friend will invite me to pick up some beers at the beer store again, aaaand even with product cycling to keep the oldest in front, it never fails that some of my hard-bought beer goes bad.

It makes me sad, and my multi-hour exploration this afternoon to see if anyone else has better ways of refrigerator organization of beer has led to absolutely nothing. It looks like most of the methods touted are there to help you organize six-packs, 12 packs, etc. - and less so to make it easy to view multitudes of single cans and bottles.

I'm hoping someone out here has the magical solution they've been secretly showing off to their beer friends for the last year, and it's all hidden under wraps. Help?",CraftBeer,1643226728

I looked on reddit and saw someone say they get that with Idaho 7. So i looked on my can and yep Idaho 7. 

After some thinking, it took me back to February 2020 when i had a similar beer with that onion flavor and God knows what! I checked my beer order history 2 years back to find that beer name and what do you know, also Idaho 7. 


Anyone else get this or could this just be a coincidence of 2 bad cans of two different beers years apart? Lol

I am currently abroad and want to have an assortment of craft beer to be shipped to me from the US. Due to time constraints, Total Wine seems like the best option. However, I am having the order (which is an assortment of cases and loose bottles) delivered (using the ‚Äúdelivery‚Äù option, not ‚Äúshipping‚Äù, as the latter is not available) to a freight forwarder I often use. I‚Äôve shipped beer to myself through them in the past with no issues.

However, this is the first time I use Total Wine and I am starting to get concerned if said delivery (which again is some cases and loose bottles) will be packed by Total Wine in boxes, or if they will bag it as if I had picked them up at the store. Because, in case of the latter, I might have to see if I can get the freight forwarder to somehow pack it in boxes for me.

Have any of you placed similar orders and have any experience? I still plan on contacting them tomorrow, but I figured I would ask here in the meantime.

3002,s6i196,notjustbrad,r/craftbeer Rule Modifications,"As voted upon in the \[What is craft beer?\]([https://www.reddit.com/r/CraftBeer/comments/s11gan/what\_is\_craft\_beer/](https://www.reddit.com/r/CraftBeer/comments/s11gan/what_is_craft_beer/)) thread, the people have decided that Goose Island and the such should be allowed but must be flaired properly. As such, the following changes have been made:

1. All posts must have flair upon submission
2. If someone posts Goose Island, Ballast Point, etc. we will NOT remove the post (so don't report it as not craft beer - we won't remove it and continuing to do so will be considered report abuse). The post must have the ""Big Beer Subsidiary"" flair. An automod notification will appear stating that this beer is from a subsidiary and it provides links to learn more. Overall this serves two purposes:
   1. If the poster knows their beer is an ABI product the comment serves to educate others who may not be aware.
   2. If the poster is unaware we won't punish them for not knowing, the mods will change the flair and the notice will serve to educate the poster.

We appreciate those that voted and contributed their thoughts. The definition of craft beer is one that can be discussed ad nauseam. We encourage that on-going dialogue, as long as it stays civil. Please keep in mind this was a purely democratic vote, the mod team does not believe it is our place to enforce our definition of craft beer is and make you stick to that definition (for what it's worth, I voted in favor of no ABI beer at all).

if I can't get Red Oak where i am, i go macro.

Not a bad deal, in fact a most excellent deal considering this beer is weighing in at 15%. Cracked open on a calm Saturday night just before a game of Trivial Pursuit. I have already downed one of these earlier while i was playing the piano but didn't pay much attention to it so now i'll give it a proper review. Poured out the liquid thick and black with super dark head that dissipated quickly. This beer smells all like brown sugar and caramel mixed together, as if you put them in a pan, heated them, and stirred them up. A slight note of chocolate but not too much, and this is a robustly strong and powerful smelling beer. I love it, actually. This beer tastes exactly like it smellls, powerful caramel and brown sugar, strong molasses and dark chocolate, slight bitter notes of coffee, and a wash of sweetness comparable to a taste of a pancake soaked in maple syrup. Mouthfeel is incredibly thick and bubbly, syrupy like a candy but not too cloying. I won't be able to drink this quickly, it is a slow sipper due to its thickness and sweetness. That's not a bad thing though, as I'm really liking the taste. Overall, I think it's a little too much on the sweet side for top marks, but holds such dominant cards in richness and power that makes it competetitve with some of my favorite brews. And at 15% oh dear lord you can f#$k me all night long. Totally digging it, let's do it again next week.",CraftBeer,1642121418

Do we strictly allow posts about breweries that meet the brewer‚Äôs association‚Äôs definition of craft (https://www.brewersassociation.org/statistics-and-data/craft-brewer-definition/), do we leave it as is, or do we require tags on things that don‚Äôt meet the definition but some still consider craft (Goose Island, Founders, etc). 

This poll will remain open for 5 days. The final vote will be the path we go, and rules will be updated to reflect the decision.

3379,rtmuhg,itisnotstupid,How was your 2021 in beer?,"\- The year I stopped trying to like New England IPA's

\- Tried my first Westmalle and absolutely loved it

\- Stopped trying to buy literally every new craft beer that comes and mostly focused in the styles I liked (mostly Belgian styles). Now would rather drink the same Chimay a few times than just buy a bunch of new beers

\- Got tired of Pastry stouts - had a bunch, liked some, realized that it is not really what i'm looking for in a beer. 

\- Found some pretty drinkable Macro beers that i'd definitely buy over some craft beers 

\- Visited Belgium and loved every moment of it - probably he most amazing beer experience i've had

\- Found a new love for Lambics. Always thought that these is a style i'd never really get into 

\- It is the year I stopped blindly supporting most of my local breweries. Now I mostly buy things that I really like instead of buying every new local beer by a new brewery.

\- Got a bit more into wine, something I ignored for years when I was deeper into the craft beer game. 

\- Stopped buying too much beer that just sits in my basement

\- Checked 250 new beers 

\- Found new love for Barley Wines

Overall it was an amazing beer year for me. A year where I kinda changed my beer habbits and stopped buying a lot of things, but an year when I feel a bit more comfortable with that hobby. 

  
How about you?",CraftBeer,1641054949
3380,rtk1ru,itisnotstupid,Wild guesses - what do you think about the future of craft beer?,"This is probably something that is depending a bit too much on your local scene but I think that it is interesting to explore. 

\- I think that big breweries will start to play around more and more with craft type of beer. Many local breweries have been looking in that direction, sadly without much success. I'm sure that they will get it at some point tho.

\- Sadly I don't see the craft scene going much stronger. New companies seem to come up every few years but almost all of them fail to distribute kegs to restaurants  or get bigger distribution. Even ""established"" craft breweries still have problem with quality. 

\- Most bars around here seem to develop a taste for a bit craftier beer which I can see going more into a direction of buying better macro beer than buying local or international craft beer.",CraftBeer,1641045911

While she's there, I'm hoping to have her hit up at least a couple breweries to pick up some brews to bring back for me. She'll be bringing the brews back via luggage on an airline so my space for brews is limited. So - I'd love to get some brews from some of the best your region has to offer.

I'm big on IPA's (pretty much all styles), stouts (especially with peanut butter as a primary adjunct), and also love good seasonals and winter ales. NOT a fan of sours, berliners, etc &amp; lagers.

The only breweries in that region that I'm familiar with or have tried, are Braxton Brewing (have had some really good milkshake IPAs from them), Mikerphone, and Listermann.

Because my space is somewhat limited, even better if you can put me onto some good bottle shops where she could theorhetically pick out some single cans from multiple local breweries. This, of course, assumes that y'all have bottle shops there like we do here in Oregon.

So let me know your suggestions. Specific beers, specific breweries, whatever. I just wanna get my hands on some stuff that I wouldn't normally be able to get.",CraftBeer,1640995726

We have tried to contact them several times this week with no luck.

3795,riwoic,GuinnessTheBestBoi,Please craft beer industry: enough with the IPAs!,"Listen, I love a good IPA and DIPA as much as any of us. It's a fantastic beer to showcase hops in all their glory and versatility. But I like to drink other beers too, and I can't be the only one. Honestly, it's frustrating walking down the craft beer aisle and seeing nothing but IPAs and IPAs and more IPAs. There are so many different kinds of beer, and there are some amazing beers from different styles on the market. But shelf space is increasingly crowded out by hundreds of different cans of IPA and DIPA. And frankly... some of it sucks. Some craft IPAs are just 60+ IBU cans of bitter ass. 

Can we get some lagers? Some hefes? Some bocks? Some dubels and tripels? Some stouts? Some obscure varieties too? Why not ESBs? Rauchbiers? Why has nobody figured out how to make commercial Incan chicha beer yet? Sours were making a push, has that already fizzled out? 

I get it, you can make a happy, boozy beer. But seriously, I just want some variety when I'm picking through craft beers. Is it just a money thing? The only people making any real variety are the bigger microbreweries (the Sam Adams, Dogfish Heads, Harpoons, and Sierra Nevadas of the world).

So I ask, craft beer makers: please branch out a little bit and help a beer geek out!",CraftBeer,1639792860

What is your experience there? Is it really worth it? Any good examples or bad ones?   
Personally I try not to store beers for too long. I still end up with 30+ bottles all the time but out of them i'd usually have like 6-7 bottles that I keep for special occasions but not really aging them.   
As an experiment I decided to keep an orval, gulden draak and a Liefmans Goudenband bottle for a few years because I ended up having too many bottles of them. 

Through the years i've tried a bunch of aged beers and had a hard time deciding if I like them better, especially since I didn't have a fresh version next to me of the same beer. 

I can definitely get the nerdy side of this as a hobby but is it really worth it? Is it just beer geeks convincing themselves that this makes beer better? I've been part of many food tastings as part of my job and I realized that my brain is really easy tricked.",CraftBeer,1639552141

I am looking to make a hand-picked craft beer gift basket for my father this year for Christmas. We now live in New Hampshire (I have been here 8 years, he and my mother moved here two years ago from California) so I would like to find him some more New England breweries to try. We have done a few beer festivals and I know he often drinks 603 Brewery, Lord Hobo, among a few others around the house, but was curious if there were some recommendations of lesser known New England breweries I could maybe find in stores that I could put together for him. He mostly drinks IPA's though I know he likes blonde ales, brown ales, and pale ales. I'll admit I am not extremely fluent in craft beer, I know what I like but trying to describe what others like or may like isn't as easy for me lol.

We are six Management students at The London School of Economics and our project focuses on how branding can influence crowdfunding opportunities for beer brands, with a focus on Brewdog.

We‚Äôd be very grateful if you could take a few minutes to fill out our short survey (not boring &amp; contains a game) to help us out. If you don't like Brewdog please fill out the survey as well (your opinion is still important).

Survey: [https://lse.eu.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV\_eKzUthIBUpyd2B0?s=r\_bp](https://lse.eu.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_eKzUthIBUpyd2B0?s=r_bp)

Responses are entirely anonymous, however, you can leave your email address for the chance to win a crate of Brewdog beer!

P.S. If you are interested in the results or have any questions, please feel free to comment below.

For the mods: although not directly related to craftbeer, we would be very grateful if you could keep the post up, it would greatly help academic research into beer branding &amp; results are applicable for craftbeer brands as well. Feel free to PM me with any questions or concerns.",CraftBeer,1639147537

4166,r8fnd1,tikivic,Craft Beer Roulette is fun. (?),"Just left dinner at a wood fired pizza place we hit 3 or 4 times a year. Great tap list. Problem tonight is that there is something up in the cold room. I ordered one of my favorite hazies. Watched her pour it from the correct tap handle. She dropped it at my table.  It was a straight up IPA. Probably Georgetown Bodhisafa, guessing from their tap list , but definitely not the hazy I ordered. 

No worries. A fine beer, just not what I ordered. I drank it. Switched to a different hazy made by a friend of mine. One that I happen to have on tap in my own bar as we type. Pulled it from the proper tap handle. Not that beer. Instead, I‚Äôm pretty sure it was a fresh hop hazy pale ale from another local brewery, just guessing from the tap list. Not a hazy IPA but not bad, so I drank it. 

Finally landed with beer number three on a normal IPA flavored IPA from another local fave that I‚Äôm pretty sure was what I actually ordered. 

Never had so much hit and miss ordering beers I‚Äôm familiar with. It ended up being sort of fun but, I mean, come on. If you‚Äôre gonna have a good tap list, at least make sure you tap the right kegs",CraftBeer,1638585821
