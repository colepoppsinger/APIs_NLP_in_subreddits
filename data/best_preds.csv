1741,college student looking for a reasonably priced machine - flair neo?Hello everyone! I‚Äôve been looking to get a new espresso machine. My roommate has a delonghi ECP3420 and I‚Äôve been using it but she‚Äôs moving out soon. I‚Äôve worked in coffee and done some research and I‚Äôve been eyeing the flair neo - I don‚Äôt need milk steaming since I only drink iced lattes/americanos. I always buy coffee beans from local cafes and ask them to grind it for me for espresso so I wouldn‚Äôt have to worry about a grinder too. I was wondering how the flair neo was when it comes to ease/speed of use and quality of espresso. I‚Äôm usually in a hurry in the mornings and I always dilute my espresso with milk or water so I guess that speed of use is a bit more important to me.

298,"How do you froth milk for only a single serving, without wasting a bunch of milk?Since I got my Gaggia Classic Pro, I haven't been very successful at frothing small quantities of milk.  I'm still really new to this, and I've only been successful at frothing milk to the correct texture if I fill my pitcher about 50% full, and froth it to about the 60-70% level.

This results in me using about 25% of my frothed milk, and pouring the rest down the drain.

My thinking is that the larger volume is needed to allow the microbubbles to roll around the pitcher correctly?  Maybe it has something to do with the way I gyrate the pitcher around afterwards?

Is there a technique that anyone knows to froth a small volume of milk?",0,0,0.8587182160348161,0.14128178396518384,0.7174364320696323

I looked at the mini Vivaldi/Lucca a53, but I don't love the non-standard portafilter or its overall appearance or how huge it is. Considered Lelit Bianca but it's really a bit too much $. I prefer the look of an E61 (love the chrome), but not sure if it's worth that much extra money to go with the Quick Mill QM67 Evo over the Silvia Pro X. I spoke to a salesperson at Chris' Coffee today and he said the steam is great on the Silvia. (He also said he actually liked the pink version and it sold out quickly--I had to ask.)  I know the Silvia Pro and Pro X are virtually the same--anyone have either and have an opinion on it (especially milk steaming/latte art ability)?

I don't have a budget it can be as much as needed. It can be single dose or not single dose. I only drink pour overs like six times a year so this would be solely for espresso. I drink mainly medium roasts and some times light roasts, never dark. I don't have any requirements for burrs being flat or conical or their sizes.

My limited research has led me to Kafatek MC4 as the top choice. It seems to be a fantastic espresso grinder and as a bonus the company is in the States if I need it serviced it should be faster than Weber Workshops for example.

Are there any other brands and choices that I'm overlooking that would be a better recommendation than the MC4? Happy to take any suggestions and compare.",0,0,0.8930285314700998,0.10697146852990022,0.7860570629401995

They refunded which is great.  Then I started my search all over again and decide I wanted the Timemore black mirror nano. But anywhere is selling it for $210-$250 (Canadian). That‚Äôs crazy. It‚Äôs the same circuitry as the black mirror just in a smaller form factor.  I think everyone‚Äôs trying to price it in the Acaia price range, but it doesn‚Äôt compare in features and functionality.  And nobody has them in stock. 

Went back to the Ali store and they‚Äôre selling it for $99 and claim to have them in stock. I‚Äôve been disappointed once by them and I know I‚Äôm taking a chance, but I think it‚Äôs worth the gamble. Worst case, it‚Äôs another dead unit and I‚Äôll get a refund.

I'm spending *way* too much on coffee out, so I've decided to get a home set up. Problem is, I'm *so* picky, and my budget is only $1500 to $2000 for both the grinder and espresso machine, and 2k would be pushing it.

I am probably going to go with the Eureka Mignon Specialita or Magnifico for the grinder.

A Dual broiler, PID, Preinfusuion (pre-wetting), Flow Control, Fast heat up time, or ability to set an auto timer. I'd like all the settings to be easy to access and change without opening the machine up or voiding the warranty.

1258,"What to look at when buying a commercial machine second hand?I saw this local place that sells its San Remo verona 2 group espresso machine with two Ascaso commercial grinders. 

New this setup would cost you between 8000 and 11.000. It is priced really low as they say they want to use an automatic machine for their coffee and want to get rid of this.

The price is enticing and I know a guy who can fully check it for me but it also makes me really want to double down on due diligence first.

This price seems only justified if:
A) they don‚Äôt know what they are selling.
B) they got it second-hand for a low price as well and again, don‚Äôt know the value.
C) something is wrong with the machine.
D) my knowledge on the value of the setup is completely wrong and I overestimated the value. 

Having a good and working commercial setup would bring me closer to my goal of having my own espresso bar someday and this looks like a real chance!

Note: I live close to the seller so can definitely check it out first but if you have any experience or tips, feel free to enlighten me!

438,"Specific Questions to Help Decide Between Breville Barista Express and the DeLonghi La Specialista EC9335We're buying our first espresso machine to upgrade our $10 Mr. Coffee drip coffee maker!

I've got it narrowed down to the two in the title - I really prefer to have a built-in grinder as we have limited counterspace to work with. Here's what I know about the two:

Breville: Non-pressurized portafilter combined with more adjustability on the grinder will make an objectively better shot with perhaps a steeper learning curve.

DeLonghi: Comes with a pressurized portafilter and fewer grind settings. While this makes it harder to mess up, it makes it impossible to achieve a really great shot. 

&amp;#x200B;

Now, despite this, the DeLonghi is more appealing to us for a few reasons:

* Built-in tamper reduces mess (We don't like mess)
* Hot water spout location means you can make Americanos without moving the cup. Seeing as that's the most common drink we drink, it's a really nice benefit.
* DeLonghi has a 2 year warranty extendable to 3 compared to a 1 year warranty on the Breville

&amp;#x200B;

My questions:

* Is a pressurized basket *really* all that bad for our first machine?
* Can't we swap it out for a non-pressurized basket anyway?
   * I know the counter to this point is that the fewer grind settings mean a non-pressurized basket would be harder to dial in; even impossible in some cases. That makes sense to me, but say I was able to dial in a particular bean within the provided grind range - couldn't I just keep using that same bean and be OK with the less adjustable grinder on the DeLonghi? This is really the crux in making our decision.

Lastly, I know we would probably be better off getting the machine and grinder separately. At least for now, I'm ruling that out. I'm really just wondering if the less-adjustable grinder and the pressurized basket on the DeLonghi make it a poor choice over the Breville, or if we can work around those limitations. 

Finally, there's about a $200 price difference. Ignore that for now as well. Thanks!!",0,0,0.9843201310005742,0.015679868999425778,0.9686402620011485

1113,"Rancilio Silvia Pump not Pumping during Extraction?As the title suggests, I may be having a problem with the water pump in my Rancilio but I am not sure. 

At first, I thought I was having poor extractions due to grinding too fine because no water was being let out during the extraction, however, even when I grinded coarser I noticed that sometimes the same thing would happen... no espresso comes out. 

Then I decided to look at the water hoses in the back during extraction to see if water was being drawn from the reservoir and it seems like nothing is happening back there. 

With the portafilter in, the water from the hoses does not pump - sometimes it doesn't pump at all and sometimes it does, but when the portafilter is out the water flows as expected.

Some of us know it as our morning fuel, or maybe it‚Äôs your special time to experiment with caf√© creations. Some of us though, like myself, know it as the reason we‚Äôre alive.

I‚Äôd probably die without it, literally.

The reason why espresso has become a part of our lives or how large a part it plays is irrelevant here. Maybe you just decided you loved how your local barista made your cappuccino and you wanted to try it at home. Maybe your suspender-man-bun hipster barista friend gave you a shot ‚Äúon the house‚Äù and from then on you were hooked. No matter what your own attraction to it is, espresso is intense, captivating, alluring, and an often mysterious phenomenon that keeps people coming back for more.

Do you have a question about how to use something new? Want to know how many grams of coffee you should use or how fine you should grind it? Not sure about temperature adjustments? Wondering about your coffee's shelf life or the best way to store it? Maybe you‚Äôd just like some recommendations on new gear?

1444,"Breville Bambino (non-pro) 2-cup doesn't flow, 1-cup works?Dear friends, this is what suddenly happened with my 6-month-old Breville Bambino (otherwise no problems):

\- with the 2-cup setting/filter basket: espresso doesn't flow at all. It stopped about 10% through a cycle a few days ago and hasn't worked since.

\- with no portafilter: water flows more or less normally, but about half the time releases a cloud of steam before beginning to flow (including video of a cycle with a cloud, but not all of them have it).

\-  with the 1-cup setting/filter basket: espresso flows as it should.

I didn't make any changes in coffee type, grind, amount, tamp, or anything at all on the day the problem began. Tried a descale although the machine didn't alert that it was needed, no improvement.

Any ideas? Can the 2-cup filter basket itself be a problem? What's up with the inconsistent steam cloud? Huge thanks in advance!!!",0,0,0.962108348744957,0.03789165125504298,0.924216697489914

I am currently abroad and want to have an assortment of craft beer to be shipped to me from the US. Due to time constraints, Total Wine seems like the best option. However, I am having the order (which is an assortment of cases and loose bottles) delivered (using the ‚Äúdelivery‚Äù option, not ‚Äúshipping‚Äù, as the latter is not available) to a freight forwarder I often use. I‚Äôve shipped beer to myself through them in the past with no issues.

However, this is the first time I use Total Wine and I am starting to get concerned if said delivery (which again is some cases and loose bottles) will be packed by Total Wine in boxes, or if they will bag it as if I had picked them up at the store. Because, in case of the latter, I might have to see if I can get the freight forwarder to somehow pack it in boxes for me.

My Silenzio settings are at about 3.1 grind size so not too fine not too course and the reason for this is anything lower will clog my machine and the water will not pass through the coffee. I use a double basket, grind 18g of beans and pull 18g of coffee. With these settings i feel like my coffee ends up a bit too sour. My first thought would be finer grind however, as mentioned before that clogs my machine and when i watch the water pass through with the settings I have now, it LOOKS like a great extraction. Not too watery, pretty thick and i end with about a 1:1.5 ratio of crema to coffee. So my next question to myself if i cant adjust grind size is, is the bean itself just sour? medium to light roast and the description did say a bit of a citrus after taste.

1474,"Grind size vs recipe (and general advice?)Hey there, I am quite new to the espresso hobby, got my first real machine 2 months ago, and am having a blast so far learning every little thing I come across.

One thing is still quite a massive question mark for me tho: How do I decide when to adjust my recipe and when to adjust my grind?

So far (not looking into turbo shots yet) basically I try to start to dial in by trying to get to 1:2 in 25 seconds, and adjusting grind size in small steps from there until sour and bitterness are balanced out. (Mostly I end up on the finer side with closer to 30-35 seconds so far, but I didn't have great, fresh beans yet, so I will see how this changes with different beans and roasts.)

Some people say: on this roast I prefer a 2.5, or these beans are better in 1.5 ristretto. But unfortunately I never heard anyone explain WHY they prefer it. What differences in taste and texture am I looking for here? 

And, maybe as a bit more vague question: after balancing sour and bitter, most of the time my shots still don't taste awesome, not as sweet as I want and a bit boring and unpleasant. Is that the fault of the beans, or are there other dimensions to tinker with? (9 bar OPV with 93C temp, PID Lelit Diana, currently on a darkish roast.)

I have a question for all of you. Everyone says the shot should be between 25-35 seconds. Recently, I started using a VST basket, very fine grind and adjusted my pro 700 brew pressure 8 bars. I find these shots to be extremely deep and balanced. You would think with a 50 sec brew time they would be over extracted and taste bitter. But no, they are very well rounded and honestly even a little sour. The sour ness is still pretty smooth actually.

Does anyone else run a lower pressure, finer grind, and much longer shot? (Well over 35 sec on purpose)

If you can still maintain a balanced shot - why not try to extract slower with a finer grind?

\- Tried my first Westmalle and absolutely loved it

\- Stopped trying to buy literally every new craft beer that comes and mostly focused in the styles I liked (mostly Belgian styles). Now would rather drink the same Chimay a few times than just buy a bunch of new beers

\- Got tired of Pastry stouts - had a bunch, liked some, realized that it is not really what i'm looking for in a beer. 

\- Found some pretty drinkable Macro beers that i'd definitely buy over some craft beers 

\- Visited Belgium and loved every moment of it - probably he most amazing beer experience i've had

\- Found a new love for Lambics. Always thought that these is a style i'd never really get into 

\- It is the year I stopped blindly supporting most of my local breweries. Now I mostly buy things that I really like instead of buying every new local beer by a new brewery.

\- Got a bit more into wine, something I ignored for years when I was deeper into the craft beer game. 

\- Stopped buying too much beer that just sits in my basement

\- Checked 250 new beers 

\- Found new love for Barley Wines

Overall it was an amazing beer year for me. A year where I kinda changed my beer habbits and stopped buying a lot of things, but an year when I feel a bit more comfortable with that hobby.

238,"A First-Time Buyer's Contemplations, Input AppreciatedHi Everyone! 

To preface this, I am very much so a beginner when it comes to the world of espresso but I've been brewing pour overs for years now and enjoy changing different variables and techniques for dialing in coffee or for my own curiosity.

I've been looking at a few machines for a while now and I keep going back and forth between them because they all seem to have features I love but have a quality that makes me look at another. I would appreciate any feedback on my thoughts be it in the form of alternative products, educating me on facts that I might have gotten wrong, or even clever solutions to the qualities that irk me for a product.

To make things easier, I will start with my coffee preferences. I drink my espresso as is, I might fancy a milk drink once in many blue moons but just espresso is my main desire. When it comes to roast preference I love medium roasts but I want to be light roast capable since I also enjoy the refreshing berry notes. 

**Budget:** Roughly $500, I say roughly because I am willing to shell out more if the quality is really that significant and I live by ""buy once, cry once"".

**Contenders:**

**Gaggia Classic Pro:** From the first glance I was drawn to this machine. Simplistic design, tactile rocker switches, great reputation of brewing great espresso, within my budget comfortably, and recommended in one way or another by the coffee content creators I watch: James Hoffmann, Kyle Roswell, and Xris. 

My main deterrents for this machine however was brought up by a coffee blogger named ""The Coffee Chronicler"". I've been told that the OPV mod for 9 bars of pressure was pretty much mandatory and temperatures can be inconsistent which calls for installing PIDs or temperature surfing. I dislike the idea of having to mod my purchase out of the principle that it should be ready to pull quality shots out of the box...because that's why I purchased it. Dialing in coffee is not the same as modding my machine in my opinion for this hobby. The OPV mod I can tolerate much more as its cheap and apparently quite easy to do but I am firmly against the idea of installing a PID but then temperature surfing sounds very inconsistent to me coming from someone who's used an electric temperature kettle for so long and appreciates a digital confirmation of consistency.

**Breville Infuser:** I came across this product while searching for a machine that has a consistent and adjustable temperature PID. The design aesthetically is honestly not my preference, the buttons don't seem very satisfying, and it's reaching out of my comfort zone in terms of budget but it allows me to control another variable.

**Breville Bambino Plus:** I've heard good things about this product from ""The Coffee Chronicler"" and that it brews a very consistent cup of coffee unlike the Gaggia Classic Pro but where it falls short is that the temperature is locked in at 200f and struggles a lot with lighter roast coffee.

1756,"Medium roast - more sour?Hi all. So I‚Äôm loving this espresso universe. I have a Sage Barista Touch, with a Eureka Specialita grinder. It‚Äôs a combo that works for me. 
My wife and I always enjoyed medium roasted coffee more than dark roasted coffee. It is as if there is more fruit and chocolate in a medium roast - typically. We never drink espressos. Only cortados and lattes. The other day I tasted a pure espresso, and it was somewhat sour. I always do 18/36, with top temperature. But now I decided to change the ratio a bit, going to 18/44, and it helped. I mean, there is still some sourness to the shot, but not much. And there is never sourness to the shots as soon as we poor milk into them - they always turn out delicate. So my question is, is there a tendency that medium roast coffees easier becomes sour? And am I doing the right thing going from 1/2 dose to 1/2.5? Would I enjoy a darker roast better? (It‚Äôs been years since we bought them - long before our espresso adventure). Are they easier to work with? Thanks!",0,0,0.9412845660839072,0.05871543391609282,0.8825691321678144

1461,"Simple Questions ThreadWelcome to the r/Espresso question thread!

Some of us know it as our morning fuel, or maybe it‚Äôs your special time to experiment with caf√© creations. Some of us though, like myself, know it as the reason we‚Äôre alive.

I‚Äôd probably die without it, literally.

The reason why espresso has become a part of our lives or how large a part it plays is irrelevant here. Maybe you just decided you loved how your local barista made your cappuccino and you wanted to try it at home. Maybe your suspender-man-bun hipster barista friend gave you a shot ‚Äúon the house‚Äù and from then on you were hooked. No matter what your own attraction to it is, espresso is intense, captivating, alluring, and an often mysterious phenomenon that keeps people coming back for more.

Do you have a question about how to use something new? Want to know how many grams of coffee you should use or how fine you should grind it? Not sure about temperature adjustments? Wondering about your coffee's shelf life or the best way to store it? Maybe you‚Äôd just like some recommendations on new gear?

There are no stupid questions here, ask any question and the community and moderators will chime in to help you out! Even if you don‚Äôt actually know the answer to a question someone asked, don‚Äôt be afraid to comment just so you can participate in the conversation.

We all had to start somewhere and sometimes it‚Äôs hard figuring out just what you‚Äôre doing right or wrong. Luckily, the r/Espresso community is full of helpful and friendly people.

You can still post questions as an official post if you feel it warrants a larger discussion, but try to make use of this area so that we can help keep things organized in case others potentially have similar questions.",0,0,0.9341425730297169,0.06585742697028311,0.8682851460594339

2793,"Any Tips for New Breweries/Beers?Hey everybody! I‚Äôm new to the craft beer scene, about two years in. I‚Äôm from the New York region and have made the trip to Tree House too many times, so I want to expand my palate. Does anybody have any good recommendations for other beers and breweries in New England or nationwide? Or even some beers that I might find at a local beer store? Any and all recommendations are very much welcome!

As for my palate, I tend to prefer exciting and hoppy flavors. But I‚Äôll break it down by categories:

IPAs
My introduction to craft beer began with soft hazies, so I tend to gravitate towards those. Tree House, Other Half, and Root + Branch are all top of the list for me. But I‚Äôm starting to like some bitterness and dank flavors. My top 5 beers are Heady Topper, King Jjjuliusss, Jjjuliusss, Focal Banger, and Very Hazy. I‚Äôm really starting to appreciate West Coast styles and have had Sierra Nevada‚Äôs Pale Ale and Torpedo a bunch. I‚Äôd like to have more beers that mix the two styles, such as Tree House‚Äôs Sap. And I don‚Äôt care for milkshake IPAs.

Stouts
Pastry stouts from Tree House are making me want to explore this style a lot more. I tried this year‚Äôs Goose Island‚Äôs Bourbon Country Brand Stout and enjoyed it more for its incredible balance than anything else. (Also I‚Äôm not sure if buying it unrefrigerated from a Costco impacted its flavor.) 

Lagers
It feels unfair to group all these styles together, but I am so inexperienced with lagers and my taste buds have been so bombarded with hoppy beers that I don‚Äôt give lagers the credit they deserve. The only lager that thoroughly impressed me was Copper Legend, a festbier from Jack‚Äôs Abby. Is there any sequence of beers that might readjust my palate to appreciate lagers like pilsners?

Sours
I haven‚Äôt enjoyed one yet. I‚Äôd like to, but nothing has done it for me.

Thanks for reading if you‚Äôve made it this far. I‚Äôd like to discover new beers and give other breweries the business, so if you have any recommendations, please let me know!",1,1,0.023002367670035384,0.9769976323299646,0.9539952646599292

I can't remember a thing of the manifacturer, but the beer itself had a silly name of 4 or maybe 3 words. It had an animal, it was agressive and if I can trust my memory, it had human in it. So somthing like grumpy beaver against humans but with more creativity.

Because my space is somewhat limited, even better if you can put me onto some good bottle shops where she could theorhetically pick out some single cans from multiple local breweries. This, of course, assumes that y'all have bottle shops there like we do here in Oregon.

I am considering changing my grinder (single dosing), and a second hand MSJ + modifications would cost me 4 times less than the df64. It is possible to use SSP burrs in both and they both have capable motors as far as I know.

I am changing the grind size between espresso and filter and it really bothers me to purge the grinder each time and waste coffee.

Also, I would like to know about the workflow.

With MSJ, is it possible to weigh the coffee, grind, bellow and not weigh it again? I am looking for a consistency in retention. Like a tolerance of 0.1-0.2 every time more or less.
Any comparative insight would be really appreciated.

1299,"Cleaning cycle grief (Sage Bambino Plus)I've been loving my Sage Bambino Plus and how fast it's ready to go, but... the cleaning cycle!

1) I can't skip it by pressing the steam-button (as the manual otherwise says), and somehow it always pops up at the most inconvenient times.
2) It always ends with a wet mess on the table, as the drip tray invariably overflows.

As a bonus info, I'm using granulated Cafiza and the (newer?) non-perforated cleaning disc that came with my machine. And yes, I empty the drip tray beforehand and place a large container under the steam arm and portafilter.

So I guess my questions are: Do you guys know of any ways to skip the cycle, other than running it before the machines prompts it itself?
And do you know of any way to avoid the soapy mess? Switch detergent? Make a small hole, so all the water doesn't go into the drip tray?",0,0,0.8963963820758649,0.10360361792413503,0.7927927641517298

1822,"Do you think there will be more upgrades from Decent or more companies making Decent like espresso machines?I've been thinking about upgrading my espresso machine, and I love the look and feel of machines like La Marzocco or Rocket, but the nerdy and analyst side of me screams to get Decent.

With Decent. I love the part where it seems very much binary and seems like I can set what I want it to do, and it does exactly that, and I don't have to rely on my timing or me having to tinker. Although IMO it looks like it could be in a spaceship, and spit out a green drink or something.

Also, the far bigger thing that worries me is, if there is going to be an upgrade soon after I buy, or new companies that offer something like Decent for much cheaper and far good looking. Watching Decent espresso machine, it almost feels like I'm watching when the Camera industry transitioned from SLR to DSLR. Before DSLR came out, people were happy with 5-10 years old SLR cameras, but once DSLR came out, a new version comes out almost every year...

Do you think the same will happen with Decent like espresso machines? It's a bit tough to spend 5-6K knowing in a year it would be outdated... But I guess people do that for Tesla, so I guess I'm just not the target market?

""How would you make each of those?""

""Ah, a cortado is equal parts coffee to milk, while a Gibraltar is 2oz of espresso and then milk to the top of the cup.""

""How big is that glass?""

""Erm, 4oz I think...""

She didn't seem to happy with me (and I feel a little bad about, honestly--even if it is, I hope, a mildly humorous anecdote for this sub.)

805,"Profitec Pro 600 - Pros and ConsHelp me, friends!

I have had my BBE for a year now and oh boy did it open the gates to the espresso obsession. I purchased a Niche Zero in anticipation for a dual boiler and I'm considering the Profitec Pro 600 with Flow Control from Whole Latte Love.

My concerns about moving from the BBE:

* Slower warm up time - I love being able to use it within a few minutes of turning it on
* Descaling the machine - seems like a much more involved process on the Profitec - we have reverse osmosis filtered water from Culligan, wondering how big of a deal it is with that consideration?

Why I'm excited considering the Profitec Pro 600

* Dual boiler - I make lattes or cortados every morning and I want to steam and brew at the same time!
* The steam power - again, I love a milk drink and I want more pressure from the steam wand!

Interested in people's perspective from moving to the Profitec Pro 600. Do you love it? What don't you like? What other machines in or below that price range ought I consider?

I'm not one of those people who has more money than they know what to do with (although I do ok), so it's a big purchase and I want to ensure I'm making the right call!",0,0,0.9507722525281079,0.04922774747189209,0.9015445050562159

527,"Having issues with light roast‚Ä¶ am I on the right track?I‚Äôve got a sage/breville barista express and been struggling with dialling in my machine and getting consistent results.

I order beans from a local roasters, Brazilian single origin with notes that my partner and I really enjoy. I‚Äôve today noticed that it‚Äôs a light roast and I didn‚Äôt know much about that impact on trying to pull decent espresso when I first ordered (subscription based). It makes me think that this may have been one of my problems. 

I‚Äôm getting ok drinks (we only drink milk based coffee) and so it is palatable but some drinks are better than others. However the shot runs pale quite quickly and just doesn‚Äôt really cut through the milk. I would describe the espresso itself as sour but unfortunately my palate is not very well developed when it comes to espresso. I‚Äôve changed the internal burrs to 2, and the external grind size is 8, if I grind finer I end up choking the machine‚Ä¶ 

Interestingly, the webpage from the roasters says:

""This style of Omni roasting coffee tends to mean that light roast single origins will also work for espresso but only with the right equipment. This means you need a really good espresso coffee grinder (like a La Marzocco Lux D) and a great espresso machine. In addition, you also need the time and energy to develop your barista skills to get the best from single-origin espresso coffee.‚Äù

I‚Äôve now ordered their ‚Äúespresso‚Äù blend to try as these beans are meant to be more forgiving.

The other things I‚Äôve done are:
1. Single dosing due to the unfortunately shoddy built in grinder
2. Upped the dose to 20g with a 40g yield aiming over 30 seconds (sometimes it‚Äôs near, sometimes it‚Äôs well over 30s and I can‚Äôt discern why)
3. Use a distribution tool before tamping 
4. Ordered a Normcore v4 tamper for consistent tamp (to remove this variable) (on back order)
5. Planning to buy an IMS basket once these become more available for breville 54mm size 

So, I will be dialling the machine back in again once the new beans arrive.

Any thoughts on my approach and if I‚Äôm on the right track!",0,0,0.995648647081982,0.004351352918018062,0.991297294163964

354,"Water help! Remineralizing RO?I am researching upgrading from the BBE I've had for just about a year to possibly a Profitec 600/700. 

Up until this point, I haven't really paid too close attention to my water, because I have RO filtered drinking water at home. My thinking - ""It won't create scale, so what else is there to worry about?""

I'm now shocked to learn that it can potentially be corrosive to a machine? (It can also affect taste, but my main worry is the affect on the machine, because no espresso is being made - good or bad - on a broken espresso machine.)

So now I'm like... oh, I need to remineralize my RO water, but I am OVERWHELMED by the info online. Some helpful Redditors suggested adding TWW crystals, which I'm looking into, but my main question right now is...

After I re-treat my water, how can I ensure I haven't ""over mineralized it"" by adding too much? I guess I'm just scared I'll create scale by using a product like that, which I really want to avoid... but I am not a chemist, this is all new to me, so I have no idea if I'm worrying about a non-issue...

Out of curiosity and desire of accuracy, I ordered the API GH &amp; KH test kit and my RO water has no hardness. This seems ideal to me, why add back calcium and magnesium!? HELP!

Next thing, she gets the pitcher, puts it under the steam wand, leaves it there while she collects the money, remembers that the milk is happily getting boiled and turns off the steam.

1221,"What would be the cost (to the manufacturer) of a 'prosumer'-grade espresso machine?  


Price Analysis:

A typical retailer in the US sells a mid-tier prosumer-grade machine for about $3000.

\[Example: top of the line Rocket, Quickmil, ECM etc.).

\---

Cost to manufacture: $1000 \[material, labor, factory space, utility, power,... \]

Markup (profit margin 100%): $1000

Distribution cost (%25): $250

Total (Manufacturer sell price to retailers): $2250. ($1000 + $1000 + $250)

Retailer marks up 30-35%(let's say 33.33%) : ($2250 \* 33.33%) = $750

Thus, the List price is approximately $3000 (= $2250 + $750).

Something is clearly not sealing, and it makes a ton of creaking noise when heating up.  It also creaks a lot when heating up to brewing temp.

1094,"Used Coffee Grinder SuggestionsHello r/espresso, you magnificent community that excels at getting me to spend money.

I'm looking to upgrade my grinder situation, for use with my Flair Signature. I'm somewhat new to espresso, having upgraded from a gifted DeLonghi EC155 to the Flair, but am quickly becoming obsessed. I have a Baratza Encore that I've modded to go finer, but I still find that the adjustability is still not quite precise enough, and I'm occasionally at the absolute finest setting with certain beans/roasts. My hope is to look for a used non-manual machine to upgrade to, since I am in no real rush to do so. What might you guys suggest is conceivable to find used for under $400? 

I don't consider a manual grinder an option, since I make espresso for guests often, and I'm hoping for an all-purpose grinder, since I do enjoy french press, pour overs, and cold brews made at home as well. I roast my own beans and enjoy experimenting.

 From my searching, I've found these, but would love other suggestions.

* Niche Zero (good luck finding one of these used, right?)
* Baratza Sette 270
* DF64

1760,"Yet another sour(?) espresso debug postI've read an insane amount of threads related to sour espresso but am still struggling with my shots - I'm hoping someone can help figure out if I'm struggling to tell **sour** and **acidic** apart. For context, I've only had espresso in Italy and at a machine at work (I believe they use some Umbria beans, can't remember) - none of them tasted like this. I've had regular black coffee at Starbucks that I would sometimes find sour - light and medium roasts I think.

I've been drinking these as a latte and they've tasted great with no hints of sourness.

Equipment:

* Breville Barista Pro (machine + grinder): I understand people might recommend using a better grinder, but it would blow my mind that this machine is only capable of producing absolutely terrible shots
* Coffee(s): [Hot Shot Espresso](https://drinkcoffeedostuff.com/products/hot-shot-espresso),  [Black Strap Espresso](https://irvingfarm.com/products/blackstrap-espresso), Costco sold Lavazza espresso. I ordered the first 2 through [trade coffee!](https://www.drinktrade.com/) to try a variety and be aware of roast dates. I've tried shots from 3-12 days since the roast date

Method:

* Weigh beans (pre and post grind): tried 15g-18g doses. Kept dose consistent while varying grinds
* Weight output in cup: tried 1:2 to 1:3(+) ratio
* Measure time: most were within 25-40 seconds, including a 5 second pre-infusion. Usually would aim for 28-30 seconds, but focussed more on output. Tested up to 50 seconds
* Grinder setting: ranged from 5-15 (varies from machine to machine it appears so probably doesn't help much). 7 and 8 seemed to be the sweet spot for the non-costco beans
* Temp: limited to what the machine lets me do, but since it's sour I've maxed it out to +5. I run a couple empty double shots through the portafilter to preheat, feels warm to touch. I don't do it every time, but I've also tried leaving the machine on for 25 minutes
* Puck prep: used a homemade (cork + needle) tool to ""fluff/stir"" the coffee in the portafilter. Tamped using the included tool, also tried using a distribution tool. I use a bottomless portafilter and 90%+ of the shots show no obvious channeling

Attempts:

* Grind finer: I've gone as far as I can where it would choke the machine, or take 50+ seconds to pour a 1:2 ratio. The setting I use gives me 25-35 second shots including 5 second pre-infusion and then I focus on the output.
* Grind coarser: Shots come out pretty fast (&lt;20s) and sour
* Increase yield: I've let a 15gm input yield a 50gm output, still sour
* Try different beans: This is my next attempt: [9-5](https://revelatorcoffee.com/products/9-to-5) which is a dark roast. I've also ordered [Lavazza Super Crema](https://smile.amazon.com/gp/product/B000SDKDM4/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o00_s00?ie=UTF8&amp;psc=1) since there's only so much coffee I can blow. I will also to get some beans from work where I know what flavor to expect.

Salami technique:

I read about the salami technique today to see if I was able to differentiate under vs over extraction. Is it possible the shot is so under-extracted that even the last bits (35+ seconds) taste sour?

I separated shots every 5 seconds from 10-45 seconds. The first 2 were absolutely horrible (different from the ""sour"" I was experiencing earlier - was more repulsive), the last 2 were watery with no real taste, the middle ones weren't as repulsive as the first 2 but still tasted sour. I could maybe see the last shot be slightly bitter but only if I was really looking for it.

For **Doug Veliky** (TT/IG: beeraficionado Reddit: /u/DougVeliky) it‚Äôs about more than just the latest trend. With an accounting background Doug joined Revolution Brewing (IG: revbrewchicago) in Chicago as the CFO 6 years ago and transitioned to Chief Strategy Officer about a year ago, now overseeing Marketing and Finance. Prior to Rev, Doug spent 8 years at the US‚Äôs largest beer distributor. There‚Äôs nothing about the craft beer world that Doug can‚Äôt speak to!

1123,"Need help dialing in my shot pleaseI need help diagnosing the shot of this new bag of beans I have. Its Bird Rock Coffee Roaster Espresso Blend and my grinder is 1Zpresso J-Max. Rancilio Silvia V1. IMS 18g basket. 18g dose.

So I've been pulling 18g doses on a 20g VST basket for a few weeks now with different beans with success. The fact that I was using a larger basket size than my shot was bothering me for no reason and I wanted to try a 18g IMS basket just because I've read that is what you're supposed to do (use the same basket and dose size).

Since I changed to the 18g IMS basket (and coffee beans) my shots have been very strange, first they pulled really slow, like in 50-60 second range and tasted really sour. As I started to grind coarser of course it would pull a bit faster but I would get tremendous channeling and spurting in the 40-50 second range. This morning I pulled coarser and had like 8 different channels and achieved a 30 second pull. the shot tasted bitter. Should I go the other the other way and grind finer again until the shot ""looks"" like a normal espresso shot (a few drops at first and then a main middle channel) even if it pulls in a long time?

I am almost certain that it is the basket the one that is affecting the most since the beans are a month old at max from a local roaster. I could just go back to the 20g VST since that was working for me before the change.

439,"Tips for running my Solis Barista Perfetta: channeling &amp; group head cleaning?I upgraded to a Solis Barista Perfetta (I know that's nothin fancy but baby steps) from a Capresso machine a while back and it's allowed me to make some really delicious espressos with a variety of beans but I've got two persistent issues:  


* Channeling in one specific spot slightly behind and out from the center
* Cleaning the group head

I don't really know how to address the first one except to try and buy some kind of dispersion screen. Is that the right thing to do? Are there other options? It regularly channels in this same spot no matter how hard or softly tamped.

Second question is basically just hygiene: What's the best way to clean grounds off the brew head between shots? I've been running a single shot through with the portafilter in to warm things up, which seems to clean it effectively but then I have to blast the portafilter with water or lightly rinse then scrape the filter with my finger to get the grounds out of the screen. Either option is annoying and cools it down a lot. Is there some basic technique for this I simply don't know? Should I be wiping the group head with a towel first? Or something?

1055,"TOTAL espresso noobI've rarely ever had any high quality espresso shots, and the Folgers instant espresso maker at work is worse than garbage, I know. But how exactly should espresso taste? To me it's too sour. I'm fine with an earthy, deep, dark brew as long as its not all sour. 

Additionally, for at home machines (which I think would be super fun to get into when I get my own place) all I know is that you press freshly ground coffee beans into a cake and insert into a maker that pulls water through it. 

How exactly does this differ from normal drip coffee though? How long should the water be in contact with the beans, and how do you know how much water to use?

I guess I'm just a little confused on the science of espresso in general.

Please excuse my total noobiness, I'm just curious and want to get into espresso.

Bottomless portafilter with IMS 18-22g basket

I dose 20gs of coffee(without RDT) into the dosing cup of df64 and pour into the basket with a dosing ring on it, then I do a little bit of WDT on the surface and temp with a self leveling temper. I also put a Bplus screen on the puck for extraction.

And as I observe channeling, I set the grind size coarser and coarser(now at 22 relative to the true zero point), but channeling is still occuring, although with coarser grind it should be less easy to happen, and the shot time now is very short to get 40g of liquid(around 16-18s), and I dont know if the quick flow rate is cause by channeling or the grind being too coarse.

Can anyone please help on what I should do next, like should I check the alignment of my burrs. And if anyone using a similar set up can share with me their grind setting such that I have a fair starting point to start with.

657,"Budget Setup SuccessI impulse bought a Breville Bambino (non-plus) a few weeks ago at a liquidation store for $150. They had a few accessories from whatever store they'd liquidated, so I got a generic ali-baba looking bottomless portafilter ($15) and a .1g scale  with a timer ($7). Picked up an open box JX-Pro on amazon for $140. So all in under $350.

I was a barista at a high volume 3rd wave shop/roaster around 10 years ago so I have made and drank a considerable amount of espresso, but after using pro machines the older generation of home offerings always seemed finicky and well... just kind of a pain in the ass, so I never considered buying one. Process (and aesthetics...) is important to me and a machine that requires all sorts of odd hacks and tricks like some of the older generation home machines just isn't appealing to me for every day use. Hadn't really looked at what was available in the realm of home espresso probably 6-7 years and was surprised to see so many more decent looking home machines and grinders at all price levels.

After getting things dialed in a bit I'm consistently impressed with the quality of shots the Bambino pulls, and how pleasant it is to work with. Sure, it lacks a bit in fine tuning options, but the manual pre-infusion and shot timing is at least nice to have. I'm consistently pulling gorgeous shots on the naked portafilter that are nearly as good as anything I can buy locally. The thermojet system seems to get ragged on a bit but it does exactly what I want it to - the machine basically pulls shots on demand, with no need to heat up a boiler, and provides a nearly instant transition between pulling shots and steaming milk. The steam wand behaves as I'd expect - my muscle memory from steaming milk as a barista still works, although my hands are a little less calloused now and I can't gauge the milk temp by feel very accurately :D

The JX-Pro has absolutely blown me away, even more than the machine. My last experience with a hand grinder was a hario skerton, which I found to be only slightly more functional (and pleasant to use) than putting the coffee beans in a plastic bag and smashing them with a rock. This thing is simply a joy to use. Consistent and easy to dial in or swap grind settings for different brew methods. Grinds efficiently enough that I don't even mind hand grinding 60g of beans for a large batch of pour over coffee to share. Extremely satisfying heft and build quality.

Altogether, it's a setup that I'm excited to use every morning, makes coffee I'm excited to drink, and looks great sitting on my counter. Hard to beat that for $350!",0,0,0.9958365703284522,0.004163429671547842,0.9916731406569044

964,"Extreme pressure from steam (Rancilio Silvia w/Auber PID)Hi all,

So first of all; I'm very new to this world, but I've studied it thoroughly - but basically no practical experience (3 weeks).

I bought the Rancilio Silvia V6 with the Auber PID (not the version with steaming).

Problem: when i steam milk i switch the steam-button on, purge the wand and let it heat up. Then it heats up to 302f and when i turn the handle, all hell breaks loose. If i fill the jug to the starting point of the nose, milk will just shoot out of the jug. If i just steam into nothing, I've noticed that the steam is not consistent; it's like dry and wet steam comes in waves, back and forth... I hope that makes sense.

Question: is the temperature too high? Should i start steaming sooner at a lower temperature? Is there something wrong in my steps?

I‚Äôve been frustrated with my older Gaggia Classic‚Äôs (unmodified) weaker steam and single boiler. Also not loving the stock pressure. I know these can be modded, and have also considered getting a PID and 6 bar OPV - I just figure at that price and effort, I should upgrade.

The benefits I see from the quick mill are:

 - simultaneous brewing and steaming (understand steam will be weaker due to thermoblock)
- 9 bar OPV
- PID
- built - in shot timer
- increased boiler capacity
- generally more aesthetic and higher build quality
- at least $900 cheaper than alternatives I‚Äôve been considering

Drawbacks:

- 10 years old
- not a full-fledged double boiler

Does anyone have any thoughts or experience with this machine?

776,"Simple Questions ThreadWelcome to the r/Espresso question thread!

Some of us know it as our morning fuel, or maybe it‚Äôs your special time to experiment with caf√© creations. Some of us though, like myself, know it as the reason we‚Äôre alive.

I‚Äôd probably die without it, literally.

The reason why espresso has become a part of our lives or how large a part it plays is irrelevant here. Maybe you just decided you loved how your local barista made your cappuccino and you wanted to try it at home. Maybe your suspender-man-bun hipster barista friend gave you a shot ‚Äúon the house‚Äù and from then on you were hooked. No matter what your own attraction to it is, espresso is intense, captivating, alluring, and an often mysterious phenomenon that keeps people coming back for more.

Do you have a question about how to use something new? Want to know how many grams of coffee you should use or how fine you should grind it? Not sure about temperature adjustments? Wondering about your coffee's shelf life or the best way to store it? Maybe you‚Äôd just like some recommendations on new gear?

There are no stupid questions here, ask any question and the community and moderators will chime in to help you out! Even if you don‚Äôt actually know the answer to a question someone asked, don‚Äôt be afraid to comment just so you can participate in the conversation.

We all had to start somewhere and sometimes it‚Äôs hard figuring out just what you‚Äôre doing right or wrong. Luckily, the r/Espresso community is full of helpful and friendly people.

You can still post questions as an official post if you feel it warrants a larger discussion, but try to make use of this area so that we can help keep things organized in case others potentially have similar questions.",0,0,0.9341425730297169,0.06585742697028311,0.8682851460594339

Recently I signed up for the Trade subscription. They send your order to the roaster every x weeks, and it gets roasted that day and shipped to you. You get a different coffee from a different roaster every time. 
My first two bags were lovely, and there was a date stamped on the package, which showed it was roasted the day/the day before it was shipped. I time my deliveries so I start using that bag about a week after it was roasted, as I‚Äôve heard that if the beans are too fresh, it can get fussy. 

Now, my third bag, there‚Äôs no stamp/written day for when they roasted. I started using it about a little over a week after the day they shipped it. It‚Äôs now about day 15. 

As usual, I just left my grinder in the setting of the last coffee, and adjust is from there. My first shot was super fast, like a waterfall. I‚Äôve gone finer and finer until I had my Sette 270 to as fine as it can go, and it‚Äôs still stupidly fast. I‚Äôm tamping it as hard as I can too. This has never happened to me. 

The coffee is Oren‚Äôs Two Bridges. It‚Äôs a light-medium roast, and I usually go for medium or medium-dark. I know that lighter roasts you need to grind finer, but this is insane! Is this normal for lighter roasts, that the finest setting of the Sette 270 isn‚Äôt fine enough? Do I need to adjust the internal grinder rings so it can go finer? Or could my beans freshness be the problem (too fresh if they did indeed shipped it when roasted, or too stale if they gave me an old bag).

1130,"DF64 2 Weeks Later - So CloseSo I've had the DF64 for about two weeks and just wanted to share my experience with it for those looking to buy one in 2022.

Rentention is still an issue, the silicone flapper is too stiff even after revision so I did the DIY mythos style mod with a thin sheet of plastic and a 3D printed spacer. With the mod, retention is reduced to about 0.2g and almost 0 with RDT and bellows. Static is not an issue for espresso but is pretty strong at medium grind size, you will need RDT or it'll make a mess. The dosing cup doesn't have much static despite being made of plastic though. 

Build is surprisingly solid, much heavier than it looks.  Some people say it looks plasticy but it's actually all metal, even the lid which is a surprise. 

Taste, coming from a Mignon MK1, is a massive improvement both before and after the flapper mod. The Mignon was super clumpy and produced more fines and shots always had some slight bitterness that lingered which was unpleasant even in an otherwise great shot. With the DF64, the bitterness is completely gone and I couldn't see any sediments at the bottom of my cups, shots have great clarity and and sweetness but have slightly less body. I also noticed I could grind quite a bit finer without choking my machine.

Overall I personally think the DF64 offers incredible performance for the money and if you are willing to take it apart to mod it's way up there with the best and there's still the option to upgrade to SSP burrs. However I still consider the Niche to be the king in this price bracket. Yes it's $100 more expensive but doesn't require modding and looks better in my opinion its only weaknesses are availability and depending on who you ask, conical burrs (not an issue for me).",0,0,0.9442633484503411,0.05573665154965889,0.8885266969006822

61,"Buying a used Nuova Simonelli Oscar 1 - worth buying? Pics in postHey,  
I¬¥m  looking to get into brewing espresso at home and just stumbled upon a used Nuova Simonelli Oscar 1 that¬¥ is for sale for 120 bucks. Owner states that it has been sitting for 5 years, but says that its in good condition and everything is working perfectly. He says that it can be tested before purchase. Is this a good price? Would an Oscar 1 be an okay beginner machine? Should I be worried that it is an older machine(maybe 10 years old?)?

I looked on reddit and saw someone say they get that with Idaho 7. So i looked on my can and yep Idaho 7. 

After some thinking, it took me back to February 2020 when i had a similar beer with that onion flavor and God knows what! I checked my beer order history 2 years back to find that beer name and what do you know, also Idaho 7. 


Anyone else get this or could this just be a coincidence of 2 bad cans of two different beers years apart? Lol

1216,"Let's talk syrups! Putting monin syrup into high quality coffee is like putting bicycle tires on a Ferrari. I own cocktail bars and we build a lot of syrups from scratch and have been for over a decade. I see a lot of your set ups have monin syrups in the background and figured this was a way I could add my voice around here. That stuff is hot garbage and you can do way better very quickly and for less money. 

First, we really need to discuss simple syrup. I've been to waaaaay too many coffee shops where an iced latte or cold brew is sweetend with thin slightly sweet water. Making a basic simple syrup is 101 and for those of you who are adventurous, hot simple syrup can be infused with just about any spice to flavor hot and cold drinks alike (so add some cardamom or cinnamon, etc and you're off to the races). Also, using true simple syrup allows you to consistently sweeten.  The recipe is:

1 part sugar
1 part hot water
BY WEIGHT! (I know you all have scales)  
Stir until sugar is dissolved

From here you can easily add the spices of your choice (cardamom, vanilla bean, cinnamon, black tea, etc etc) just make sure the syrup is warm and you give ample time for infusion.

Instead of monin orgeat try:

1 part almond milk 
1 part sugar
BY WEIGHT!
3 - 6 drops orange blossom water 
3 - 6 drops rose water 
I like mine with the expressed oils from a few orange twists (not the twists themselveS) 
Blend until sugar and almond milk are incorporated. 
This will seperate over time but just shake it.

Anyway, if anyone is interested in this sort of thing let me know what you're interested in and I'll do a follow up post with more recipes.",0,0,0.8643975395588057,0.1356024604411943,0.7287950791176114

221,"Upgrade from Rancilio Silvia v. 3 w/ PID to a Rancilio Silvia Pro XAfter serving as my daily workhorse machine for almost a decade, I just upgrade to a Silvia Pro X. I know there is not much information about this machine out there yet from actual users, so I figured I'd post my initial reactions after five days of daily use (perhaps.... too much use as I experiment with grind size). 

1) The quality and durability seem to be what you except from Rancilio Silvias. One of the screws in the top plate was not screwed in straight, which I found.... odd.... from a quality control issue. There was a small bead on the white paint on the steel side. My old v. 3 was just stainless and I opted for white with this machine. 

2) The upgrades, especially the variable soft infusion and double boiler, are game changers. I was pretty adept at pulling delicious beautiful shots with my v. 3 after years of barista experience on pro machines, but the Silvia Pro X's upgrades really do up my game with pulling shots. I also think the  pressure gauge, dual boiler, and built-in shot timer are really helpful. I'm not sure if this is just my adrenaline based on my excitement playing with a new toy, but I do believe the pressure when pulling a shot is much more consistent from beginning to end. It could be that my old v.3 was just showing its age. 

3) The portafilter and tamp feel much nicer than the v. 3. I will upgrade the portafilter to a bottomless with walnut handle, as well as upgrade the steam knob to the same and purchase an upgraded drip tray. 

4) This machine is much heftier and takes up significantly more counter space. I used to have a Rancilio stand with drawers for temp wands, scale, and a built-in knock box, for the sivlia v. 3, but the Pro X will not fit under my cabinets on the kitchen counter with the stand. 

5) I was really hesitant purchasing a new model machine without seeing one in person first. I thought I'd go with another brand machine in the $1800-2500 price range, but at the end of the day I feel very much at home with the Rancilio brand. 

In any case, I am happy with the purchase and would make it again. Now if I can figure out how to slow down with my daily espresso intake.....",0,0,0.9934784395263748,0.0065215604736251565,0.9869568790527496

I‚Äôm using the built in grinder with some San Francisco Bay Decaf Espresso - Dark roast (2lbs bag off Amazon to learn on).  There‚Äôs no roast date listed.
